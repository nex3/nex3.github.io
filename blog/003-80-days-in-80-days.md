I fully forgot about this until @authorx reminded me just now, but back in 2022 I ran an [_80 Days_](https://www.inklestudios.com/80days/) race called "80 Days in 80 Days" where the conceit was that each player could only spend a single in-game day per real-time day (for a game that's only supposed to take a few hours for a leisurely run). It's not the sort of thing that could only take place on Cohost, but it's the sort of thing where only Cohost would get into it as whole-heartedly as it did. People were emailing me their updates in full character as Passepartout, with @Zandra even sending her updates _in French_. @RatBaby won the race in only 36 days. We had more than 30 participants, over a third of whom made back to London.

[The website I made](https://80-days-in-80-days.com/) is still up, complete with an interactive globe showing everyone's routes and a bunch of fun achievements I came up with. What a lovely little moment that was. Thanks again to everyone who joined me for it.
