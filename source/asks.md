## Send me an ask at [ask@nex-3.com](mailto:ask@nex-3.com)!

* Anything you send to this email might get posted to this blog. Be prepared!

* Sign off with the (nick/screen)name you'd like me to use, and include a link
  to your website if you want me to make your username a link. If you don't,
  I'll just pull something from the "From" field.

* I'll grab an avatar from your website if you've got one. If you don't I may
  use a silly anonymous image instead. For kicks.

* For the most part I'll post the text of your ask as written, but I do reserve
  the right to improve the formatting and so forth. I'll also probably cut out
  the greeting and signoff.
