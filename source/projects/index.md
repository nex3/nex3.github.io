# Projects

I get up to all sorts of shenanigans if I'm left alone for too long. This
doesn't include projects that are just tech infrastructure because that's not
what this website is for.

## Active

* [**Her Majesty the Prince**](https://www.scribblehub.com/series/982373/her-majesty-the-prince/)
  is a novel-in-progress by [Alex Zandra], with contributions by me. I have
  poured my heart and soul into helping with this book, contributing to the
  overall plot, the characterization, and the dialog. Zandra's work on this is
  absolutely fantastic, and I'm so honored that she's involved me in it as much
  as she has.

* The [**_Dark Souls III_ Archipelago world**](https://archipelago.gg/games/Dark%20Souls%20III/info/en)
  is a plugin for the [Archipelago](https://archipelago.gg) multi-world
  randomizer that adds support for randomizing _Dark Souls III_. I didn't
  create it initially, but I _did_ do the massive 3.0.0 rewrite that added
  tons of new features, locations, and bug fixes. I'm still actively
  maintaining this and trying to get new features up and running.

* I've maintained [**Moddy**], a _Magic: the Gathering_ [cube] since 2011, and
  run weekly cube drafts consistently the whole time (on [MTGO], these days).
  It's a modern-era cube (allowing cards that were designed in the modern era
  even if they're not legal in Modern) that prioritizes a diversity of deck
  styles and an empirical approach to balance.

* I run [**cube rotisserie drafts**] whenever we get enough people signed up to
  make quorum. These have gradually evolved into being mildly-elaborate
  streamed productions, and you can see [older videos] on YouTube.

* I periodically write [**medium-form non-fiction**] on this very blog. My
  current favorite is ["COVID Denialism and Disability Justice"].

## Finished

(Or like, on hiatus but perfectly usable.)

* I've written a few tiny bits of fan fiction that I'm particularly fond of:

  * [A Moment in the Sky](a-moment-in-the-sky), for _The Legend of Zelda: Tears
    of the Kingdom_ (warning: major plot spoilers).

  * [Eulogy for G5 Iguazu](eulogy-for-g5-iguazu), for _Armored Core VI_.

* I made a [**Sekiro randomizer bingo card generator**](/bingo), which I claim
  is one of the more advanced randomizer bingo card generators in existence. I
  also created [a little library](https://github.com/nex3/bingo/) that can be
  used to make similarly advanced bingo card generators for other games,
  although to my knoweldge neither I nor anyone else has done so yet.

* I've made a number of contributions to the
  [**Elden Ring Wiki**](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/), including
  writing a number of the pages for basic combat mechanics like [Stance] and
  [Parrying] and formatting the data for all the bosses. I also data mined and
  formatted combo charts for a substantial chunk of bosses through the midgame.

* I organized the [**80 Days in 80 Days**](https://80-days-in-80-days.com/)
  race, in which contestants played Inkle's excellent game
  [_80 Days_](https://www.inklestudios.com/80days/) while moving forward only
  one in-game day per real-time day.

* I collaborated with Mags to create several silly images. Generally I did the
  writing, Mags did the drawing.

        alt: "A Disco Elysium themed comic in the style of Niel Cicierega's Ariel Needs Legs",
        style: "max-width: 400px" %}
      Harry Du Bois is on a beach speaking to Kim Kitsuragi. They're drawn in an
      intentionally slapdash, MS Paint-esque style.

      ###### Panel 1
      Close-up of Kim and Harry.\
      **Harry:** Wow you're cool\
      **Harry:** Nice car

      ###### Panel 2
      Harry and Kim are silhouetted walking along the beach.\
      **Harry:** I'm... a cop?\
      **Harry:** You smell like chestnuts\
      **Harry:** I like talking to you

      ###### Panel 3
      Harry raises his index finger and looks into the sky while Kim watches
      impassively.\
      **Harry:** however Guillaume Le Million was the only Revacholian disco
      artist to chart at number 1 on three non-consecutive occasions

      ###### Panel 4
      Harry shows Kim a flute. Kim continues to watch impassively.\
      **Harry:** Yeah I'm working on a disco flute remix of The Smallest Church
      in Saint-Saens

      ###### Panel 5
      Harry is playing the flute, spraying spittle in Kim's face. Kim is
      grimacing.\
      **Harry's Flute:** FEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE\
      **Coeur de Metier**, a _Disco Elysium_-style skill for Kim: [Trivial:
      Success]: Ohhh you can't not fuck him

      help.)

      Agent 47 dressed in the flamingo suit from the Miami level from _Hitman 2_,
      rendered in the style of _Untitled Goose Game_. 47 is walking along a stone
      path in a lawn behing a green building, carrying a wrench. A _Hitman_-style
      dumpster is nestled against the building, and in front of it a crowbar lies
      nestled in the grass.

      A middle-aged, balding catboy sits at a desk with a newton's cradle, an old
      CRT with cat ears, and a name plaque that says "Mr. Sniffles". He looks
      bored and annoyed. A blonde woman in a blouse sits across from him.

      ###### Panel 1
      **Woman:** But I filed the form just like you told me!\
      **Mr. Sniffles:** I'm sorry ma'am, but you filed **fur**m Q-thirty-one. I
      asked for Q-thirty-**mew**.

      ###### Panel 2
      We see a poster on the wall of a naked man hanging from a tree branch,
      labeled "Hang in There!"\
      **Mr. Sniffles:** As such, your application to re**felin**ance your
      **mrrt**gage has been de**nyaa**ied.\
      **Woman:** Oh my god... what happens now?\
      **Mr. Sniffles:** **Purr**suant to **claws** 113(b), we will re**paw**sess
      your home. Please va**cat** the premises within two **meow**nths.

      ###### Panel 3
      The woman begins sobbing.

      ###### Panel 4
      Tears stream through the womans fingers as Mr. Sniffles idly baps the
      Newton's Cradle off the desk.

* I designed the first few iterations of the **[MTGO] modern cube**, as well as
  the [**Nega-Cube showcase**].

* I collaborated with Leslie Kam, Jesse Mason, and Liz Cady to make a *Magic:
  the Gathering*-themed [cocktail](/assets/cocktail-menu-1.png)
  [menu](/assets/cocktail-menu-2.png) (and throw a cocktail party with it) as
  well, of course!

* I collaborated with Liz Cady to make [**_Game Jam Jam
  Game_**](/projects/game-jam-jam-game), a silly little Twine about making jam.
