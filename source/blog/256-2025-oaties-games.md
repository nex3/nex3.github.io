This year, I think I'm going to split up my oaties post into two, one for games
and one for films. I don't want the posts to be massive, especially since I'm
going to continue the tradition I established last year of updating my all-time
of-the-year lists along with choosing individual years.

I'll be honest: I'm not feeling great about the state of video games in 2025. I
certainly missed some games that might change my opinion here—notable games I
didn't get around to that I think I stand a shot of really loving include
_PEAK_, _Shadow Labyrinth_, _Of the Devil_, and _Kinophobia_. I'll mention
_Despelote_ as well as a game I watched {% mention "Eden" %} play most of and
thought very highly of. But on the whole, this year leaves a bad taste in my
mouth and makes me feel like a hater.

I always try to muster precise and thoughtful critiques of games I don't like,
especially when I know other people feel differently, and that often means I'm
putting myself in the position of thinking as much about the games I don't like
as I do about my favorites. This year, though, it felt like I was endlessly
pouring out criticism with only brief intermissions for auditions.

Many people, including numerous friends of mine, loved [_Blue Prince_], [_Donkey
Kong Bananza_], and [_Hades II_]. I found all three of these flawed in ways that
were actively repugnant to my design sensibilities. That's not to say I didn't
enjoy them, but the fun I had felt like digesting *content*, that increasingly
refined slurry of choose-three mechanics and the steady drip-drip-drip of
unlocks. The failures, on the other hand, were born of deep misunderstandings of
the player's perspective-in-the-moment—the very experience whose careful
shepherding is what I find most compelling about the very best game design.

[_Hades II_]: https://backloggd.com/u/nex3/review/3449368/

I was looking forward to [_Civilization VII_] so eagerly I took time off work to
play it with {% mention 'Liz' %}. It was so disappointing we abandoned it after
two days. Even games I broadly quite liked, like [_Q-Up_] and [_Demonschool_],
were marred by notable design flaws.

[_Demonschool_]: https://backloggd.com/u/nex3/review/3874058/

That's not to say there weren't games I enjoyed this year, but looking back at
them I'm faced with the horrifying realization that everything I really loved
this year was a sequel or a spinoff. [_Fish Fear Me_], [_Monster Train 2_],
[_Elden Ring: Nightreign_], [_Death Stranding 2_], and [_Hollow Knight:
Silksong_] all remix or reinvent their source material to some degree, and I
think they're all excellent. But the knowledge that none of them (nor _Hades II_
nor _Civilization VII_) is fully original haunts me.

## Game of 2025: [_Hollow Knight: Silksong_]

{% image '/assets/256/silksong.webp' %}
{% endimage %}

This is kind of a shoo-in choice, if I'm being honest. There are only three
games I gave five stars this year. _Nightreign_ is certainly my most played of
the three, and (similar to my reasoning for picking _Elden Ring_ as my game of
2022) exploring it and developing strategies with friends was a unique joy. But
it's also got plenty of flaws itself—not so many as to make it not an absolute
favorite, but enough to keep it from being a serious competitor for the top
seat.

I liked _Death Stranding 2_ a lot more than many. I don't entirely disagree with
[Carolyn Petit's critiques] of the game; there are certainly ways in which its
mountain of quality-of-life improvements over the first game feel like sanding
down some of the unique character, and while I like the fact that stealth-action
sequences were more of a real thing I don't disagree that they do bring it
closer to a normal AAA game (and certainly closer to _Metal Gear Solid V_). Its
biggest strength is its narrative, but that's also the only thing that's a truly
substantial change relative to the original.

[Carolyn Petit's critiques]: https://kotaku.com/best-games-2025-despelote-terminator-2d-absolum-pac-man-shadow-labyrinth-blippo-2000656278

So that leaves _Silksong_. While it's not flawless, the quality of design is
excellent across the board. And what makes me most impressed is the ways in
which it plays off and even undermines the expectations of its predecessor. It's
a sequel in the vein of _Metal Gear Solid 2_ or _Dark Souls 2_: one that's
unafraid to reimagine the constraints of the original. _Silksong_ begins with a
bold mechanical declaration, that the downward aerial attack that was the bread
and butter of _Hollow Knight_ combat was no more, and builds outwards from there
with utmost self-confidence. Team Cherry are among rarefied company in their
willingness to use friction as part of their palette, and more importantly they
do it without simply copying From Software's notes.

For all that I'm a little sad to have to pick a sequel, _Silksong_ certainly
deserves its place as my game of the year.

## Games of the Years

I didn't play that many games from outside 2025 this year, and the only one I
really loved was [_Slay the Princess_] which for all my esteem can't really
compete with [_Void Stranger_] for the 2023 slot. As a result, the only changes
to my GOTY lineup are from other cleanups or reevaluations:

[_Slay the Princess_]: https://backloggd.com/u/nex3/review/2600340/
[_Void Stranger_]: https://backloggd.com/u/nex3/review/1157609/

* 1988: I've added _Tetris_ as my game of the year. I didn't actually play any
  new games from 1988 this year, but I did realize that (despite Backloggd
  categorizing it as a 1989 release) the first documented commercial release of
  the game was [in 1988]. That puts '88 over the five-game minimum that
  qualifies it for a place in my GOTY list, and _Tetris_ beats out _Super Mario
  Bros 2_ and _3_ (both entirely delightful games) because, come on, it's
  fucking _Tetris_.

  [in 1988]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris_(Spectrum_HoloByte)

  Despite _Tetris_ being moved out, 1989 gets to remain in the list with _Wonder
  Boy III: The Dragon's Trap_ sneaking in as the fifth entry. I played the 2017
  remake, not the original, but I generally count remakes as the same year as
  the original unless they're wildly different.

* 1994: _The Incredible Toon Machine_ displaces _Jazz Jackrabbit_. Both of these
  are childhood favorites, but I'd forgotten to mark the former on Backloggd
  until this year. While the OG Epic shooter platformer was an absolute
  fascination for young Natalie, as an adult I find the _Incredible Machine_
  open-ended approach to puzzle design and the ways it presents challenges in
  what is fundamentally a sandbox much more interesting.

* 2008: _Metal Gear Solid 4_ replaces _Armored Core: For Answer_. I played MGS4
  at the beginning of 2024 and I'm not sure why I didn't make this change during
  the previous update. I like ACFA just fine, but MGS4 is a multimedia
  masterpiece in its own right as well as the culmination of the primary arc of
  the most fascinatingly metatextual AAA franchise that ever has or likely ever
  will exist.

## Bonus: Hundo Club

We welcome two new entrants to the [hundo club] this year: _Elden Ring:
Nightreign_ which I played 277 hours of (mostly with friends but not
insignificantly also taking photos for the wiki) and _Death Stranding 2_ on
which I racked up 121 hours just playing through the main plot while taking
diversions to do optional deliveries whenever I felt like it, which turned out
to be a lot of the time. Shouts out as well to _Against the Storm_, already a
member of the club from last year but which I'm pretty sure Liz and I managed
another hundred hours of this year.
