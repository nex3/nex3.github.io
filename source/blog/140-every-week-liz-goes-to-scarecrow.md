Every week, {% mention 'Liz' %} goes to [Scarecrow Video] and grabs a bunch of
movies for me at random off my Letterboxd watchlist. But as I power through
movies week after week, year after year, that watchlist is dwindling...
especially for English-language films I can watch while doing other stuff. So
she's started throwing in the occasional movie that catches her eye from one of
Scarecrow's many exciting curated sections. At the same time, I have absolutely
no memory for what I put on my watchlist and why. So every time I watch a movie
now, it's a fun game for me to try to figure out if someone recommended it, if I
saw someone else on Letterboxd enjoy it, or if Liz grabbed it sight-unseen.
