referring to a place by an exonym is imperialist but using the local language for it is appropriative, so please be sure to refer to locations by coordinates _only_. unfortunately longitude is eurocentric so please instead use the new Coordinated Universal Meridian which places 0Â° latitude at the weighted median location of all of Earth's population, updated annually based on the latest available data and published in the Coordinates Universal Meridian Mandatory Yearly Supplement
