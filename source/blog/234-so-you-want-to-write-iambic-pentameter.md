  <p>There's this persistent idea in discussions of iambic pentameter that the
  English language is "naturally iambic." This isn't really true at all â€“ it's
  kind of a meaningless statement. What <em>is</em> true, however, is that
  English does feature a lot of two-syllable words, and a lot of recurring pairs
  of one-syllable words that tend to be stressed as iambs; pairs like "up to",
  "go in", "if I," and so on.
  <p>These are the basic building blocks of iambic verse, and most texts written
  this way will favor shorter words. A very common sentence structure privileges
  one longer word surrounded by short little words; in the line "now is the
  winter of our discontent," the only long word is "discontent", which almost
  acts as a cornerstone for the whole line.

I found this practical approach to writing iambic pentameter very interesting.
Although much of it is specific to that form, I think a lot of the concepts are
generally applicable to verse writing. This is a useful tool in any writer's
toolkit, even if you're not specifically writing poetry or stylized video games.
A working understanding of the rhythm of text and how to align it with its
meaning can do a lot to improve the flow even of pure prose, and understanding
it better will certainly increase your appreciation of verse works like
Shakespeare.
