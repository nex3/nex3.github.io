{% mention 'Zandra' %} has a song she sings about this frog:

ðŸŽµ Push a block, ring a bell,\
ðŸŽµ send a frog straight to hell

ðŸŽµ Turn the clock round and round,\
ðŸŽµ put a frog in the ground

ðŸŽµ well it's a long, hard, cold day in hell\
ðŸŽµ but that's especially true for a frog\
ðŸŽµ and it's a long, hard, cold road ahead\
ðŸŽµ so watch out if you happen to be a frog
