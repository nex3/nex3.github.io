[Readers may recall] that at the Seattle Cohost wake, I helped establish a
mailing list—Emerald City Eggbugs—for local COVID-safe events to help keep the
local Cohost community intact and allow it to expand into something new in its
own right. To help kickstart that process, I've scheduled the inaugural Emerald
City Eggbugs event, a showing of the Wachowskis' 1996 film [*Bound*] at the
[Beacon Cinema] in Columbia City.

If you're in Seattle and you want a fun, COVID-safe time with cool friends,
please come join us! Here's the critical information:

**When:** 11AM on Sunday the 24th of November\
**Where:** The Beacon in Columbia City, 4405 Rainier Ave S. It's about a 15
minute walk from the Angle Lake station, and the 7, 9, and 50 stop right outside
the door\
**RSVP:** [On Partiful](https://partiful.com/e/mjmmXfP6FDXMPwSrCWRH)\
**Price:** $10 suggested donation to [@nweiz on Venmo]. I hope to make this a
recurring event, but renting theaters isn't cheap so this would help me keep it
sustainable. But if $10 is hard on your wallet please come anyway! [NOTAFLOF]\
**COVID:** Please wear a mask (N95 or better) and run an over-the-counter test day-of or the night before. If you can't afford one, [Mask Bloc Seattle] can probably hook you up. [Outsider Comics] in Fremont usually sells them at-cost as well. The theater will be selling concessions, but we ask that you eat them outdoors rather than during the film. The theater itself is not a masks-required space at other times, although we will be the first event of the day and I've asked the person running the show to mask and test as well. I'll also be bringing a CR box to help filter the air while we're there
