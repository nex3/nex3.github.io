  A man in a life jacket and torn-off cargo shorts stands on a rowboat holding
  in one hand a fishing rod and in the other the demonic-looking fish it has
  caught. All around the rowboar, vicious-looking fish and other sea creatures
  rise from the water, intent on the stoic fisherman's blood. Above in bold
  lettering spidered with cracks is the text "FISH FEAR ME".

I had a lot of fun with [_Snake Farm_], the old darling of the Cohost set, and I
was prepared to have a lot of fun with its follow-up (more of a spiritual
successor than a direct sequel). But _Fish Fear Me_, released yesterday, is so
much more than just _Snake Farm_ on a boat. While it shares the sardonically
apocalyptic writing and the broad structure of hunting dangerous beasts across a
week's time, it's also got a tremendous amount of depth that makes it feel
immensely tantalizing to dive into over and over.

There are of course the most explicit ways in which the game draws you forward:
unlike its predecessor, it has a persistent currency that allows you to become
more powerful over time, as well as quests that unlock new build options and
even new regions to explore. I haven't sailed to the end yet, but there are
hints of an overarching metagame quest beyond just "play a bunch of games and
pay off your life debt", which I'm very excited to see. And I don't want to
downplay theseâ€”they're great additions and give the game a sense of exploration
over time that _Snake Farm_ never had.

But what interests me more are the emergent ways that it generates depth. The
core mechanic is, hilariously, a use of the most standard fishing minigame in
video games: hold a button as a line moves and release when it's in a particular
region. But doing this consistently while also navigating your boat and
murdering fish presents a serious challenge: if your eyes are on the fishing
minigame, it's difficult to maneuver in more than the roughest strokes. If your
eyes are on your boat, it's difficult to reliably succeed at the fishing
minigame.

As a result, you end up shifting your own human skill allocation between
different parts of the game, constantly adjusting how much you care about seeing
more fish versus how much you care about killing those fish and collecting their
remains (not to mention other concerns like _where_ to fish, whether it's fished
out, your own health, and so on). It's an astonishing amount of depth for such a
simple mechanic, especially one that _also_ works as a cute reference to so many
fishing games of a different nature.

_Fish Fear Me_ is out now, and as I write this it's even on sale for $8. You
should go buy it, and play it, and tell all your friends.
