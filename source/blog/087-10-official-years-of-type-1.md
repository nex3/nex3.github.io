    As of today I have (officially) stayed alive with Type 1 diabetes for ten
    years<sup data-fn="65a6a9d0-9f63-4d6b-a976-39a2cc9cbb3f" class="fn"

    >. I’ve done a little bit of reading on the history of Type 1 treatment, one
    of the first acute conditions turned chronic through medical intervention
    (thank you, Drs. Banting, Macleod, and Best). The longer I live, the more “I
    would have died by now” milestones I pass, and the more I am reminded of how
    grateful I am for advances in diabetes treatment. I have passed the “I would
    have lived this long on a starvation diet” milestone. In a few years, I’ll
    probably make it past the “lethal atherosclerosis” line, then the “renal
    failure” line, assuming I retain access to current diabetes and other
    medical technology<sup

    >. I’ll probably also mostly avoid the non-lethal sequelae, the blindness
    and the amputations and the peripheral neuropathies. Apparently in a few
    years I’ll need to start taking statins even if my cholesterol is good,
    because diabetes often brings vascular complications. As good as diabetes
    technology is, I am, fundamentally, manually running one of the primary
    metabolic loops in the human body. It’s decidedly imperfect even when
    running at top performance.

It's really tough for me to read this post which is, to a substantial degree,
about the hypothetical of my wife dying. But I think it's worth sharing both as
a celebration of the fact that she is very much alive and as a meditation on
what life is like with only the ongoing application of modern medical treatment
between oneself and the void.

Also, I gotta say, I _am_ pretty proud of that beverage. The flavors meld really
well—I wanted to make sure the black sesame was still very much the primary
note, which it absolutely is, while giving it a bit of richness with the scotch
and cacao as well as a touch of liveliness with the amaretto and absinthe. I
might actually seek out more black sesame ice cream to be able to make this for
friends.
