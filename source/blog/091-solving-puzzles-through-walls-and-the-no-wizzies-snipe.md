  <p>On July 18th, I documented my Low% route, including a discovery I'd made. It is possible to <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YsVnuRbW9Fn61ebcqF7l-_5elx2LLCxcX_m42nJagTs/edit#bookmark=id.w1ftlyn88xi4">snipe Hedges 2</a> while standing on the top of the mountain. The description of the trick included the following picture and caption:</p>

      <p>The panel is completely invisible because it is blocked by the castle wall -- however, the wall has no collision so the panel is still solvable.</p>

  <p>This statement is false.</p>
  <p>It was an understandable assumption to make. There's no reason why that wall needed to have collision coded into it, since it wouldn't be occluding anything in normal gameplay. It's common for game developers to cut corners in places that don't really matter. But it remains an incorrect assumption.</p>

I don't do speedrunning myself, but I find the act fascinating and delightful to
watch and especially to learn about. There's an intrinsic human drive,
distributed across the entire species, to fractally explore every aspect of the
world we live in. It's what drives us to do science, it's what drives us to
understand mathematical structures, and it's at least a part of why art speaks
to us as strongly as it does. I find speedrunning to be a particularly pure
expression of this drive, the progression from enjoying something to wanting to
enjoy it to its fullest to diving so deep into it that it expands into a world
of its own.

Hatkirby's writeup of the process of discovery and the fallout of one particular
trick in _The Witness_ is fascinating and at times hilarious. I recommend giving
it a look if only to discover why specifically it's called the "No-Wizzies
Snipe". I bet you won't be able to guess.
