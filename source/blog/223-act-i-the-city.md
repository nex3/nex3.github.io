For the past several years, I've been a contributing writer for Zandra's
serialized novel _Her Majesty the Prince_. I'm really proud of what we've done
with it, and if you haven't yet started reading, you've got a great chance:
Zandra is beginning to re-serialize all the existing chapters on her blog, now
complete with dates to help keep track of the non-linear timeline and a few
other tweaks and improvements (including the incredible tarot card Act art by {%
mention 'Allison Vansickle', url: 'https://www.astrawitch.com/', nickname:
'Astrawitch' %}).
