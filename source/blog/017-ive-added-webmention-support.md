I've added WebMention support, both sending and receiving (although not
currently displaying). I'll write more about that later. I've tightened up the
[microformats] I'm using and, particularly including them on nested embeds. It's
fun and I'm happy to have this blog set up to play real nice with all these
interoperable standards... but so far I don't know anyone else who I can
actually interoperate with.
