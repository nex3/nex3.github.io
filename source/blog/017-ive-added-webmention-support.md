I've added WebMention support, both sending and receiving (although not
currently displaying). I'll write more about that later. I've tightened up the
[microformats] I'm using, particularly including them on nested embeds. It's fun
and I'm happy to have this blog set up to play real nice with all these
interoperable standards... but so far I don't know anyone else who I can
actually interoperate with.
