    doing my level best to replace my "click over to Cohost" instinct with
    "click over to my RSS reader" instead of "click over to Mastodon"

    it's actually really nice to take the time I'd normally spend
    purposelessly<sup class="footnote-ref"
      ><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup
    >
    browsing social media and spend it reading a blog post instead. I read
    pretty slowly so it always takes some dedicated time to get through anything
    longer than a few paragraphs, and it feels good to actually dedicate that
    time intentionally

          I actually think that taking a few minutes to totally context-switch
          your brain to something low-key and fun before context-switching back
          to more serious work is really valuable, at least for the way I work.
          It's like giving my brain a quick rinse.

okay this is still true but I am faced once again with the fact that I read
really slowly even when I'm focused so it's very easy for me to just evaporate
three quarters of an hour reading a blog post. doubtlessly pleasant, often
rewarding, but not without danger
