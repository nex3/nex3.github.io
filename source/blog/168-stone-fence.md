Today we got an ice machine! Well, technically, we got an ice machine like seven
years ago, when a local bar whose owner we befriended upgraded and wanted to
offload their old one for cheap. But today we finally had a plumber in to hook
the ice machine up! And now we've got lovely clear cubes[^1] that look
incredibly nice in the glass. I'm looking forward to making some really lovely
built drinks in the coming months.
