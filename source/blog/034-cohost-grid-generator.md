  Hey, just wanted to thank you for making cohost grid generator, and hoping that you will keep it up online! It works great with bearblog and it makes my media posts look nice!
{% endask %}

Yeah, I plan to keep all my generators online more or less indefinitely (except maybe letterboxd which does cost a bit of money to host a proxy). I might actually rework the grid generator a bit to be more explicitly targeted at general websites rather than just Cohost. Maybe add a mode where it provides you a simple stylesheet so it can use fewer inline classes and actually make the text properly responsive so captions look better on phones.
