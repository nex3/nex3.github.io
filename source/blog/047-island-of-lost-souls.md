    This is deceptively compelling. At first glance, the ape men, broken
    english, and doctrine that all animals converge on the perfect (evidently
    white) human form feels teleological with a distinct flavor of eugenics. But
    as the film progresses, it builds out a much more nuanced narrative. "Are we
    not men?" cry the islanders, taught this mantra by Moreau himself. But
    Moreau does not truly want them to see themselves as fully human. To him
    they are at their most compelling, and their most useful, as a sub-human who
    will do his bidding without ever being his equal.

    Although Moreau's work isn't precisely secret, he is coy about it, and when
    he speaks to the mainland about the other inhabitants of his island he
    refers to them as "the natives". This gives away the allegory: Moreau is a
    colonizer and the beast-men his colonized subjects. Whatever he has given
    them has come with a terrible price: not just subservience but subhumanity.
    When Bela Lugosi's striking Speaker of the Law accuses Moreau of making them
    "not men but things", I hear it not as a tired admonishment to avoid
    meddling in the natural order, but as a claim that it is Moreau
    himself—despite his vaunted laws—who prevented them from becoming fully
    human.

    It's telling that where H. G. Wells's novel is structured around the
    tendency of beast-men to revert to their bestial instinct, the film pushes
    this thread far into the background. The climax of the plot is no longer
    driven by instinctual violence, but by words: the Speaker of the Law
    confronts Moreau and declares his laws void because they are built on lies
    and hypocrisy. In their way, the beast-men are more rational than Moreau
    himself. The film ends by challenging the core dichotomy between "beast" and
    "man" at its root and suggesting (surprisingly deftly for a film made within
    Wells's lifetime) that the concept of "sub-humanity" is itself inhuman.
