title: "the thing about Tilda Swinton's hypothetical doppelganger Swilda Tinton"

is that if anyone *were* going to have a doppelganger with a spoonerized name it
would be her. she's made multiple films about basically that. so while I'm not
claiming that Swilda Tinton exists (although I'm not claiming that she doesn't)
I just wanna say: it makes sense. it makes sense!
