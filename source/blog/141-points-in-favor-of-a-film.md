    Every week,
    <span class="mention h-card"
      ><a class="p-name u-url u-uid" href="https://seaslug.garden/">Liz</a
      ><data class="p-nickname" value="JhoiraArtificer"></data
      ><data

      ></data
    ></span>
    goes to
    <a href="https://scarecrowvideo.org/">Scarecrow Video</a> and grabs a bunch
    of movies for me at random off my Letterboxd watchlist. But as I power
    through movies week after week, year after year, that watchlist is
    dwindling... especially for English-language films I can watch while doing
    other stuff. So she's started throwing in the occasional movie that catches
    her eye from one of Scarecrow's many exciting curated sections. At the same
    time, I have absolutely no memory for what I put on my watchlist and why. So
    every time I watch a movie now, it's a fun game for me to try to figure out
    if someone recommended it, if I saw someone else on Letterboxd enjoy it, or
    if Liz grabbed it sight-unseen.

points in favor of a film being a Liz Special:

* it's gay (Liz often pulls from queer film rec shelves)
* it's obscure (less likely to be recommended to me)
* it's bad (my friends have great taste but random Scarecrow shelves can be
  pretty hit-or-miss)
