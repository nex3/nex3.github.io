The scene opens on the second day of Rosh Hashanah as the dawn light comes up,
slowly over a minute or more illuminating the bed in which **Natalie** and
**Liz** doze together, not quite asleep. Eventually, from offstage the sound of
the weekly trash collection is heard.

**Natalie:** Happy garbage day.\
**Liz:** Happy garbage day.\
**Natalie:** Garbage day tovah.\
*A pause. **Liz** snickers.*\
**Natalie:** Yom ha'garbage.

Both women break down laughing uncontrollably, until **Liz** gets up and begins
her day.
