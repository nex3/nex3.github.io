I love that people are thinking about how to make chunks of the web reusable in
standalone contexts, but I really truly deeply with that all the solutions like
htmx and web components weren't so hopelessly intrinsically tied to JavaScript.
I cut my teeth on the ideals of the semantic web and I strongly believe that a
web page should be fundamentally usable with JavaScript disabled. For highly
interactive applications I concede this as a lost cause, but it breaks my heart
to think that personal websites and blogs, which are essentially plain
hypertext, are being built on technologies that simply can't work without
scripting.
