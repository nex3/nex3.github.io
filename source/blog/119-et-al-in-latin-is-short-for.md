The Latin phrase *et al* is short for *et alium*, meaning "and garlic",
originally used in recipes to indicate that they should include the baseline
ingredients considered obviously delicious additions to all foods. It gradually
got extended to mean "and the other obvious additions" in a broader sense, and
with this meaning was adopted into various Romance languages and those
influenced by them, such as English.
