{% ask "MÃ¡xima" %}
  Have you tried using serializd for reviewing and logging TV Shows?
{% endask %}

I actually do log what I watch there kind of sporadically. It's all right! I
wish it had a better app and were a bit more like Letterboxd in general, but
it's certainly better than Trakt, its most direct competitor.

Part of the reason I don't use it is the lack of the app, but part of it is also
that it's a lot of effort to log _every single episode_ of anything I watch, but
if I only log season-by-season I'll often forget to log at all when it comes to
the finale.

The final nail in the coffin of using it the same way I do other review apps is
that I just don't have that much to say about _a single season_ of a television
show. (I find I have similar issues when I try to write reviews for manga
volumes.) There's often not that much different from the season before or the
season after, and I'll usually express everything I have to say about the show
in the first review or two and then run out of steam.
