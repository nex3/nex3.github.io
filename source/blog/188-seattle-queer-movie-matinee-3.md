After two pretty intense films, I wanted to switch it up this month. We'll be
showing the classic conversion therapy comedy romp, But I'm a Cheerleader,
featuring early performances from Natasha Lyonne and Clea DuVall. Hope to see
you all there!

* **What:** [_But I'm a Cheerleader_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/But_I%27m_a_Cheerleader)
* **When:** 11AM on Sunday the 30th of March
* **Where:** The Beacon in Columbia City, 4405 Rainier Ave S. It's about a 15
  minute walk from the Columbia City station, and the 7, 9, and 50 stop right
  outside the door.
* **RSVP:** [At this link](https://partiful.com/e/UuoyzybjJYhYNElJyW0J)! The
  theater seats 48, so we shouldn't run out of space, but please RSVP
  nevertheless!
* **Price:** If you can send $10 to [@nweiz on
  Venmo](https://account.venmo.com/u/nweiz) to help keep these going, I'd
  appreciate it, but if you can't afford it please come anyway.

**COVID precautions:** Please wear a mask (N95 or better) and run an
over-the-counter test day-of or the night before. If you can't afford one, [Mask
Bloc Seattle](https://linktr.ee/maskblocseattle) can probably hook you up.
[Outsider Comics](https://outsidercomics.com/) in Fremont usually sells them
at-cost as well. The theater will be selling concessions, but we ask that you
eat them outdoors rather than during the film. The theater itself is not a
masks-required space at other times, although we will be the first event of the
day and I'll ask the person running the show to mask and test as well and I will
be bringing a large portable air filter.

Hope to see you there!
