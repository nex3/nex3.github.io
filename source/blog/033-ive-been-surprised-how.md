I've been surprised how many people I've seen posting about how they're using RSS _again_. I guess even when talking about "the heyday of RSS" I was assuming that it was mostly more people joining and not using it than people stopping that caused its decline. I for one have been using RSS pretty much daily since the early 00s. My biggest complaint with Cohost was not having a notion of a post being "read"!

I guess I can grow and change but at my core there's still that fourteen-year-old who's determined never to miss a [_Dinosaur Comics_](https://qwantz.com).
