With 2024 [truly over] and finding myself with the day off work, I want to take
the time to write a retrospective of the media I enjoyed over the past year. I
like "best of the year" decisions as a driving force for this sort of
retrospective not necessarily because it matters all that much what gets chosen,
but because putting disparate works of art that I like for very different
reasons up against one another inspires me to focus on what specifically I value
about each of them and how I prioritize my values.

[truly over]: /blog/hot-take-december-should-not

In addition to picking favorites, I'm going to post my updated of-the-year lists
for both films and games. These are living lists I've been curating for years in
which I choose my favorite example of the medium for _each_ year[^1]. This helps
mitigate the problem that I don't ever see or play everything in a given year
and so my "best of the year" at the time is never going to be fully-informed,
and it gives me a better perspective into years long past as I explore what they
have to offer. Historically, I've updated these lists throughout the year as I
watch particularly good films, but for most of this year I've been saving the
updates to do right now. It's a fun way to look back on what the year has
brought to my doorstep and how my tastes have changed.

[^1]: There are a few additional rules. I only list media from a year where I've
      actually seen or played five or more films or games, respectively. Despite
      sometimes appearing on Letterboxd, television shows or episodes,
      miniseries, and filmed stage productions are not eligible for the list.
      Games are placed based on their initial release year, even if they're
      ports, remasters, expansions, DLC, or episodic releases—unless they're
      *so* transformative as to be functionally different games, like *Resident
      Evil 2* (2019).

## Film

I don't have concrete numbers prior to the first full year I was using
Letterboxd, 2019, but I'm pretty confident 2024 was my lifetime high-water-mark
for most films watched (so far) with fully 251 films under my belt. 2019 was my
previous high point, in a year during which I was walking to [Scarecrow] every
week and really starting to ramp up my independent theater attendance with {%
mention 'Christa' %} and {% mention 'Liz' %}. The pandemic brought that all
crashing down. In 2020, I only watched 139 films; in 2021 and 2022 I didn't even
hit a hundred.

Part of this was just where my attention was at. I was more focused on video
games in those years for my leisure activity, and in 2022 in particular I got
deep into helping out with the _Elden Ring_ wiki. But I missed film, and it felt
like something else the pandemic—and the [total lack of mitigating behavior] on
the part of the general public—had taken from me. Starting to dig back into film
last year and going so deep this year has been a healing experience, especially
since so many of the films I've seen have been with dear friends and a few have
even been in the theater (with a heavy-duty mask on, of course).

[total lack of mitigating behavior]: /blog/covid-denialism

There are a few focuses of my film watching this year. The directory I watched
the most of was Orson Welles ([_Othello_], [_F for Fake_] for the third time,
[_The Lady from Shanghai_], and [_Touch of Evil_]—almost all films that are
brilliant in their way but also somehow compromised, except for _F for Fake_,
which is perfect). But the director that really crystallized the most for me was
Sidney Lumet. I only watched two of his films this year, [_Fail Safe_] and [_The
Anderson Tapes_], but they got me to look back on the incredible quality and the
sheer variety of everything else he's done and realize that he's quietly become
sort of a touchstone director for me across many decades and genres.

### Film Of 2024: [_I Saw the TV Glow_]

[_I Saw the TV Glow_]: https://letterboxd.com/nex3/film/i-saw-the-tv-glow/

{% image '/assets/157/i-saw-the-tv-glow.webp' %}
{% endimage %}

The decision between this and [_Challengers_] was the toughest I've faced since
2019. Both films are, on the surface, genre pieces that are intense to the point
of near absurdity. Both rotate around messy interpersonal relationships between
damaged people who still strive in their flawed ways to build something real
with the people around them. Both are at their roots deeply grounded in queer
experiences while also refusing to allow that queerness to be a constraint. They
seek to draw the lines between the experience of being queer and the experience
of existing in a world that demands rigidity along _all_ lines.

[_Challengers_]: https://letterboxd.com/nex3/film/challengers/

Both films mean the world to me. _Challengers_ made me whoop and holler, and _I
Saw the TV Glow_ made me weep. I need art to give me both of these experiences
like I need air to breathe.

But I put myself to the task of choosing just one because such a choice
crystallizes my understanding of what films mean to me. And my choice—at least
this year—is _I Saw the TV Glow_ because I realized one of the things I value
about it is its _specificity_. Both films speak to experiences that resonate
deeply within me, but _Challengers_ I think hits that note for a broader swath
of audiences while the knife point of _I Saw the TV Glow_'s most cutting points
land for fewer people.

After all, this isn't my pick for the _best_ film of 2024. I don't know what
that is and I don't care. This is the defining film of 2024 _for me personally_,
and hitting me personally so precisely gives _I Saw the TV Glow_ a narrow edge.

### Films of the Years

I made a point during this year of trying to watch more older movies to cover
gaps where I didn't yet have five movies. While I haven't yet managed to extend
my streak of contiguous years—I've still only seen four films from 1970, up from
three last year—I did add 1931 ([_Study No. 8_]), 1944 ([_Laura_]), 1948 ([_The
Red Shoes_]), 1949 ([_Begone Dull Care_]), 1950 ([_Sunset Boulevard_]), 1951
(_The Lavender Hill Mob_), 1953 ([_Roman Holiday_]), 1957 ([_12 Angry Men_]),
1959 ([_Some Like It Hot_]), and 1960 ([_The Bad Sleep Well_]) to the list.

New winners I saw this year:
  
* 1958: [_Touch of Evil_] replaces [_A Movie_]. I love experimental short films,
  but _A Movie_ is not among my favorites and _Touch of Evil_ for its flaws
  gives me a lot more to chew on.

* 1967: [_Le Samouraï_] replaces [_PlayTime_]. Both of these films are flawless
  gems of the form and choosing between them broke my heart. Not for the last
  time this year, I ended up making the decision as much because I remembered
  what was magnificent about _Le Samouraï_ better at the time as anything. New
  years resolution: rewatch _PlayTime_ with at least one person.

* 1972: [_The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant_] replaces [_Solaris_]. _Solaris_,
  while magnificent, is solidly among the lesser Tarkovskys, while _Bitter
  Tears_ is an incredible psychodrama and _tour de force_ of performance from
  Carstensen and Hermann especially.

* 1979: [_Alien_](https://letterboxd.com/nex3/film/alien/)[^alien] replaces
  [_Stalker_]. It may seem like a rough year for ol' Andrei, but he's still got
  three films on the list so who's he to complain. _Alien_ edges this one out
  through the absolute precision of its depiction of its world.

* 1994: [_Chungking Express_] replaces [_Four Weddings and a Funeral_]. When it
  comes down to romcom versus romcom, I am honor-bound to pick the one that is
  more beautiful and poetic.

* 2000: [_State and Main_] replaces [_Songs from the Second Floor_]. Both of
  these films are very funny, but _State and Main_ is genuinely a great time
  while _Songs from the Second Floor_ is more along the lines of darkly amusing.
  Girls, as the poet said, just wanna have fun.

* 2005: [_Summer Time Machine Blues_] replaces [_Imagine Me & You_]. As much of
  a mark as I am for the British rom-com format, I have to admit that the craft
  that goes into making a compelling and fun time travel story is _way_ more
  impressive.

* 2020: [_The Father_] replaces [_The History of the Seattle Mariners_].
  Honestly I'm not sure the latter _really_ counted in the first place given
  that it was serialized. Although _The Father_ is quite good, it's not quite on
  the same tier as some of the other films on this list. But then, 2020 was a
  weird year all around.

[^alien]: Technically I had seen _Alien_ before this, but it really didn't click
          with me until this viewing so I'm counting it as a film I saw this
          year anyway.

## Games

I didn't play a lot of games this year, but I did play games a lot. Between
_Dark Souls III_ [Archipelago] runs, a _Dark Souls_ SL1 run, and the [_Elden
Ring_ DLC] I continued to dump an incredible amount of time into From Software's
oeuvre, and that's without counting the time I spent watching friends play. As
always, {% mention 'Liz' %} and I put a solid chunk of time into _Civilization
VI_, but more than that the release of [_Against the Storm_] captivated us as it
quickly hurtled itself into the [hundo
club](https://www.backloggd.com/u/nex3/list/hundo-club/)[^2]. Naturally, I also
spent some time captivated by [_Balatro_], although not as much as some.

[_Against the Storm_]: https://www.backloggd.com/u/nex3/review/1406883/
[_Balatro_]: https://www.backloggd.com/u/nex3/logs/balatro/

[^2]: Shouts out to {% mention 'Aura' %} for inspiring me to assemble this list.

The real surprise star of this year, though, showed up a little late to the
party. It was, of course,

### Game of the Year: _UFO 50_

{% image '/assets/157/campanella.png', style: 'image-rendering: pixelated' %}
{% endimage %}

I don't want to take the wind out of the sails of the review I'll write for this
game once I finish it, some three hundred or so hours after starting, so I'll
keep this brief. I came to _UFO 50_ a few months after it launched. I'd heard
friends, mostly arcade and retro enthusiasts at first, singing its praises for a
while, so I decided to check it out on the assumption that I'd find a handful of
its 50 games entertaining enough to justify a few hours of play.

I was not prepared for how good this game actually was.

I have, at time of writing, played 40 of these games, beaten 35 of them, and
cherried[^3] 31 of those. There are only three games that I would say I don't
like; the vast majority I consider good to excellent. Some of them are genuinely
brilliant concepts that could easily hold up a full ten-hour game in their own
right; some of those even _are_ full ten-hour games in their own right. The
amount of genius shoved into this pack is astounding.

[^3]: A cherry is the in-game representation of not just beating a game, but
      mastering its systems so well that you can achieve another, tougher goal
      on top of mere victory. A cherried game's disk appears shiny and red on
      the main screen.

But the real heart of why _UFO 50_ is my game of the year is the same reason I
chose _Elden Ring_ in 2022: the people I play it with. My little discord has a
dozen or so people all playing, dipping into different games in different
orders, swapping hints and strategies and cheering each other on. Everyone has
different games they love, and I've lost count of the number of times I
considered a game not worth attempting whether from difficulty or from
frustration, only to have someone who loved it come guide me all the way to a
cherry. It is a microcosm of what I imagine the experience of going to an arcade
with a crowd of friends must have been like in its heyday, and that's incredibly
precious to me.

### Games of the Years

It's a lot tougher to get new years onto the games list than films, just because
of how much longer it takes to seriously play a video game. Nevertheless, the
original [_Populous_] made my fifth game for 1989, allowing me to add _Super
Mario Land_ (a game I frankly don't feel that strongly about) to the end of the
list.

[_Populous_]: https://www.backloggd.com/u/nex3/review/1686388/

New winners I played this year:

* 2001: [_Silent Hill 2_] narrowly beatis out _Metal Gear Solid 2_. Both
  obviously excellent games, I can't argue that MGS2 isn't more important, but I
  personally value how effective SH2 is as a horror story—a genre that I think
  gets done a huge disservice by video games more often than not. I think 2 is
  also my least favorite mainline _Metal Gear Solid_, albeit only because of the
  sterling competition.

* 2017: [_Hollow Knight_] displaces _Night in the Woods_. This is one where
  recency bias could definitely be a factor; I haven't replayed _Night in the
  Woods_ since it came out, and I still have extremely fond memories of its
  writing and bittersweet mood. But _Hollow Knight_ brings the mood in spades as
  well, on top of an extremely compelling mechanical core and the experience of
  playing it through with a friend.
