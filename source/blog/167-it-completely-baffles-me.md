It completely baffles me that (continental) Europeans have such a strong desire for dubbed TV shows and movies. I can sort of see it for animation, since there's an inherent gap between the visuals and the audio and it's somewhat more likely to take place in a setting that's kinda unmoored from cultural context. But for live action it's totally befuddling. The language is an inextricable part of the world which the show creates, not to mention a crucial part of the actors' art and the rhythm of the scene! Drives me absolutely batty
