The thing about making the world a better place is that all you have to do is make the world a better place. You don't have to dismantle capitalism, you don't have to stop every atrocity you've ever heard of, you just have to wake up most days with the intention to leave things better than you found them. There's so much that needs doing, and even if you just do a bit of it you're helping.
