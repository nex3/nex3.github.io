I bought an art from [Missing] and it's amazing! They do such great work,
everyone reading this should commission them to make the cool wizards of your
dreams!

  A woman is wearing a tattered dress but clean apron and shawl over it. She has
  a large hat with string wound around and dangling off it, holding a few sprigs
  of nettles to the cap. A basket of nettles is looped over one arm. Her hands,
  wearing rubber gloves for safety, are working a mortar and pestle. She has a
  scythe on her belt and is wearing a black mask over her nose and mouth.
