it's actually really nice to take the time I'd normally spend purposelessly[^1]
browsing social media and spend it reading a blog post instead. I read pretty
slowly so it always takes some dedicated time to get through anything longer
than a few paragraphs, and it feels good to actually dedicate that time
intentionally

[^1]: I actually think that taking a few minutes to totally context-switch your
      brain to something low-key and fun before context-switching back to more
      serious work is really valuable, at least for the way I work. It's like
      giving my brain a quick rinse.
