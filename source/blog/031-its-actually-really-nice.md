    doing my level best to replace my "click over to Cohost" instinct with
    "click over to my RSS reader" instead of "click over to Mastodon"

it's actually really nice to take the time I'd normally spend purposelessly[^1]
browsing social media and spend it reading a blog post instead. I read pretty
slowly so it always takes some dedicated time to get through anything longer
than a few paragraphs, and it feels good to actually dedicate that time
intentionally

[^1]: I actually think that taking a few minutes to totally context-switch your
      brain to something low-key and fun before context-switching back to more
      serious work is really valuable, at least for the way I work. It's like
      giving my brain a quick rinse.
