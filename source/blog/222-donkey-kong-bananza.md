  I miss 3D exploration platformers. I grew up on <em>Banjo Kazooie</em> and
  <em>Donkey Kong 64</em> captured my childhood imagination like nothing else.
  These are both deeply flawed games, of course, and I would struggle to bring
  myself to call either one "good" today. But to my young sensibilities, they
  held the promise of intricate and captivating spaces full of things to do and
  goodies to obtain.<br /><br />The peak of this evocation of the joy of
  exploration—and this one I <em>will</em> stand by even as an adult—was
  <em>Super Mario Sunshine</em>. The worlds in that game were vibrant and alive,
  each completely distinctive and full of personality that was elaborated on as
  they subtly shifted form from one shine challenge to the next. And then they
  never made another game like it again. <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> comes
  closest, but while kingdoms like New Donk City were just what I wanted, others
  like Sand Kingdom felt like mere open world content grids. Still, I was
  excited to see what this team would do to iterate on the concept.<br /><br />Sadly,
  <em>Bananza</em> went in just the opposite direction. The core concept, a
  landscape made of almost totally destructive material, produces a design that
  is by its nature at odds with the intricate and captivating spaces that I
  still yearn for. When you can smash through any wall, there's no room for
  secret passageways or bespoke assets. Even the notion of "rooms" itself is
  barely relevant for the worlds you actually move through. The designers have
  can avoid this when they choose with an unbreakable metal material that forms
  the foundation of every world and is occasionally used for proper walls, but
  it's clear they resist the urge to do so because they feel (rightly!) that
  using it more than sparingly would undermine the core principle of the
  game.<br /><br />The result is exploration that doesn't feel like moving
  through an intricate, meticulously designed space. Instead, it feels
  <em>muddy</em>. The form of a space doesn't matter, because it's made to be
  unmade. To a large extent (although mercifully less as the game goes on and
  develops more interesting nouns) you can just blast through terrain at random
  and find bananas just... there. Not in a location with an interesting design,
  not through a challenge, just buried under some largely undifferentiated
  Substance.<br /><br />To be fair, there are actually six or so materials in
  each world. But this is part of the muddiness: nearly everything in every
  world is made out of some combination of rock, dirt, metal, gold, or a couple
  world-specific materials. Unlike <em>Odyssey</em>'s rich worlds full of
  bespoke assets, every place in <em>Bananza</em> looks more or less the same.
  This makes it very difficult to navigate, but worse than that it means the
  different places within a given layer don't <em>feel</em> distinct, and so
  even layers that have a lot of interesting verticality to them leave me with
  the same impression as an open world content grid. When movement within a
  space feels trivial, the space itself feels trivial.<br /><br />The titular
  Bananza mechanic reinforces this sense of triviality. This mechanic is harmful
  to the game even beyond its own bounds, because it provides the player with a
  dilemma at all times. Most challenges in the game will be absolutely
  trivialized by activating Bananza. The early layers are full of concrete walls
  that can't be broken by DK's normal fists. They can instead be broken either
  by throwing explosive blocks at them, and so they present a lock-and-key
  mechanism that forms the foundation of a number of cleverly designed
  challenges and puzzles. But once you've activated Bananza, you can just punch
  through them like any other material.<br /><br />But at the same time, there
  are challenges that absolutely, unavoidably <em>require</em> a Bananza. And
  the distinction are never clear: some bosses can't be beaten without Bananza,
  some are only remotely interesting if you avoid using it. Most puzzles are
  trivialized by gaining a bunch of extra powers, but a few can't be solved
  without those powers. So if you're staring at a puzzle, wracking your brain
  for a solution, there's always a chance that the only legitimate answer is
  "you should cheat" and also always a chance that cheating will totally deprive
  you of the fun of actually figuring it out.<br /><br />The fundamentals on
  which this game is built are flawed. They misunderstand what's fun about the
  exploratory promise of the genre (although I suppose I have to admit that
  others may be looking for different things from the genre than I am given the
  game's average rating). But I will say this: the level design itself speaks to
  a huge amount of skill from the designers. They took a flawed premise and did
  the best they could with it, and the result is still pretty impressive
  considering the raw material. Some of the challenges, like finding the lost
  Fractone pieces by sculpting the terrain so they have a flat path to walk to
  their parent, speak to a way of engaging with the terrain that almost makes
  the premise seem worthwhile. But even that tremendous skill wasn't enough to
  make me want to reliably pick this up and keep playing.
