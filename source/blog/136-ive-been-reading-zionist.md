I've been reading [Zionist Relations with Nazi Germany], a fascinating book that
makes an extremely compelling argument[^1] that the Zionist cause as well as
many individual Zionists threw European Jewry as a whole under the bus during
the Nazi years and particularly during the holocaust in order to eke out the
highest possible number of Jews emigrating to Palestine in particular. The book
emphasizes the solidarity between Palestinian and Jewish liberation, by framing
the Zionist philosophy as collaborationist not just in practice but at its
roots: Zionism is fundamentally the agreement with the antisemitic trope that
Jews are a separate nation who do not belong in solidarity with the other
inhabitants of the countries they have made their diasporic homes.

[^1]: Pointedly using *only Jewish-authored sources* to avoid charges of
      antisemitism!

What the book *doesn't* point out explicitly, but I've realized while reading
it, is another aspect to why Zionists seemed so blasé about averting or
mitigating the murder of six million Jews[^2]. Because who were the six million
Jews who died in Europe? They were specifically those Jews who *did not
immigrate to Palestine*. The holocaust was, by and large, a slaughtering of one
of the most potent threats to Zionist ideology: non-Zionist and anti-Zionist
Jews. And Zionists demonstrated (and stated outright) again and again that their
first priority was establishing a Jewish state, not the welfare of actual Jews,
so *of course* they didn't lift a finger to stop it. The Nazis were doing them a
favor.

[^2]: This is abundantly clear in both their actions and in Zionist primary
      sources during and immediately after the holocaust. Zionists only started
      accurately portraying it as the massive culture-defining tragedy that it
      is once it was safely ensconced in the past—and even then, actual
      survivors were reportedly look down on in Israel as weak and pathetic.
