  People told me this was "the good one", the non-FromSoftware game to finally
  execute well on the formula, and I was ready to believe them. I found the
  "gritty steampunk fairy tale" theme a little tired but I was ready to give it
  another chance. I really was open to this game being good.<br /><br />This
  game is not good.<br /><br />The bitter irony is that the thing that's maybe
  hardest about aping <em>Dark Souls</em> is having a collection of fun,
  compelling, and distinctive boss fights, and that's
  <strong>the only thing</strong> this game does right. There are a few boring
  bosses and one that I think is actively bad, but the majority of the roster
  are legitimately very fun. The combat's emphasis on perfect guarding and
  limited support for dodging (including some moves that simply ignore iframes)
  means they lean pretty heavily towards rhythm memorization, but that's my
  preferred style anyway. And it's certainly not the only thing going on—the
  best fights are also about positioning and learning when you can get in what
  sort of attacks.<br /><br />But as fun as the boss fights can be, the game
  surely makes you suffer between (and sometimes during!) them. The first, most
  egregious sin is the writing. The game is from a Korean dev, so it's tempting
  to lay the blame at the feet of the localizer, but I'm confident that the
  underlying writing is terrible. That's not to say that the localization is
  good—more on that below—but it's very clear that even if the prose were
  marvelous the concepts being conveyed are insipid, boring, and deeply
  unsubtle. Nowhere is this clearer than in the figure of Gemini (pronounced
  like "Jiminy", <em>get it</em>), whose entire role in the narrative is to
  explicitly describe things that were already completely clear from subtext in
  gratingly unskippable voice lines. But truly, nearly every line of dialog or
  lore writing in the game ranges from ham-fisted to outright nonsensical, so
  that even the lore and character moments that are compelling (and there aren't
  zero of those!) fall completely flat without any kind of supporting
  structure.<br /><br />The writing isn't helped by one of the worst
  localizations I've ever seen that doesn't straight up break rules of spelling
  and grammar. Descriptions of the same thing use inconsistent wording, and
  descriptions of different things overlap. Idioms are misused or overused like
  someone cribbed writing notes from an 80s sitcom. Major mechanics have
  descriptions that are flat-out inaccurate to how the game behaves. If you want
  to understand how the game works, you need a wiki not because the game's
  descriptions are oblique and left to the player to explore, but because
  they're <em>untrustworthy</em>.<br /><br />If you're thinking, "well if it's
  fun to <em>play</em> I can deal with skipping through the text", think again.
  Outside of boss fights (and even in them to a degree), the design
  sensibilities of this game are frequently thoughtless and haphazard. While the
  core combat mostly works for fighting large, strong enemies, it falls apart
  entirely for weaker mobs, which die in one or two hits without any resistance
  throughout the entire game. For a combat system built around the idea that you
  can essentially parry any attack, parrying is irrelevant to 90% of the
  respawning enemies. Compare to <em>Sekiro</em>, where even very early mobs
  won't let you just walk up and hit them until they die without blocking you
  and forcing you to engage in a microcosm of the mechanics used by the
  bosses.<br /><br />The game is just <em>full</em> of blunders like that. The
  "fable meter", which is used for special weapon-specific attacks, becomes
  completely irrelevant two or three bosses in once you get an amulet that gives
  you a huge across-the-board damage boost when it's maxed out and so motivates
  you never to use your fable attacks. This is one of not two but
  <em>three</em> different equipment meters you have to keep track of during
  combat, all three of which are <em>mostly</em> irrelevant. There are some
  interesting ideas here, but they're all fumbled or half-assed.<br /><br />So
  don't play <em>Lies of P</em>. If you must, find a mod that just throws you at
  the bosses with nothing in between but maybe some build management. And please
  pray that when there finally is a worthy disciple of FromSoftware's teachings
  I won't be so burnt out on these failed pretenders that I don't even bother to
  give it a glance.
