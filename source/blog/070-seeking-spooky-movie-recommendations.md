    For the past several years, I’ve treated October as an excuse to watch the
    Big Famous Movies (horror edition) that I’ve never gotten around to
    watching, plus some other ones thrown in that are on-theme. So far Natalie
    and I have done:
  </p>

  <p><strong>Draculas month</strong>, featuring:</p>

  <ul class="wp-block-list">
    <li><em>Dracula</em> (1931). The One with Bela Lugosi</li>
    <li><em>Dracula’s Daughter</em> (1936)</li>
    <li><em>Dracula</em> (1958). Lee/Cushing, delightful</li>
    <li>
      <em>The Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires</em> (1974). Hammer Horror and
      Hong Kong martial arts crossover.
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Bram Stoker’s Dracula</em> (1992). has also inspired a different
      project, “watch every film costumed or designed by Eiko Ishioka”
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Zombies month</strong>, featuring:</p>

  <ul class="wp-block-list">
    <li><em>Night of the Living Dead</em> (1968)</li>
    <li><em>Dawn of the Dead</em> (1978)</li>
    <li><em>Day of the Dead</em> (1985)</li>
    <li>
      <em>Evil Dead II</em> (1987). watching <em>Evil Dead</em> in the Draculas
      year inspired the zombie theme
    </li>
  <li><em>One Cut of the Dead</em> (2017)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Aliens month</strong> (ongoing this year!), featuring:</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li><em>Alien</em> (1979)</li>
  <li><em>Aliens</em> (1986)</li>
  <li><em>Invasion of the Body Snatchers</em> (1956)</li>
  <li><em>Invasion of the Body Snatchers</em> (1978)</li>
  <li><em>The Thing from Another World</em> (1951)</li>
  <li><em>The Thing</em> (1982)</li>
</ul>

<p>
  So here’s where you come in: what are some important themes we could do?
  What goes on those lists? I’m largely looking for The Big Ones (like the
  Romero trilogy, <em>Alien</em>, <em>Dracula</em>, stuff like that), but give
  me any sleeper hits you think really should not be missed and what theme
  they go with. I don’t do great with loving depictions of torture or
  human-on-human violence, but if you think there’s something I
  <em>really</em> shouldn’t miss for cultural reasons, recommend it and let me
  know whether I should prepare myself going in.
</p>

<p>
  Future themes we’re rotating in our minds include:
  <strong>Vampires</strong> (non-Dracula edition),
  <strong>Ghosts</strong> (<em>The Shining</em>, <em>Poltergeist</em>,
  etc),<em> </em><strong>Horror Comedy</strong> (things like
  <em>Evil Dead</em> would go here), <strong>Witches</strong>, and
  <strong>Werewolves</strong>. Any major categories we missed? Recommendations
  for movies to add to theme year reprises are also welcome.
