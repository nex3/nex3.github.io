I truly detest the fact that the new Brand Synergy MTG Secret Lairs don't have
real artist credits. They're crediting "SQUARE ENIX" for [Final Fantasy cards]
and "B3: Fire, CH: 58" for [Avatar cards][^hideous]. These are real pieces of
art made by specific human beings (yes including the 3D model)! It used to be
kind of a big deal in fantasy art circles to get your art on a Magic card, and
these people aren't even going to get credit for it. Reducing the credit line to
just listing the owner of the copyright is a shameful act, and while I know
enough not to be surprised at WotC for it, I'm still disappointed.

[^hideous]: As a side note, look how hideous that card is. The art is visibly
    lower-res than the rest of it. I remember back in 2005 MTGSalvation kids
    would get a cracked Photoshop install, download the card frame PSD, and the
    first thing they'd do would be to disable all the frame elements and add a
    stroke to all the text and just have it hovering in empty space over
    full-frame art from their favorite TV show. This is embarrassing.
