  Who's your favorite background/minor character in Her Majesty The Prince? (named or unnamed)
{% endask %}

Ask me this on three different days and you'll probably get three different
answers, but right now I'm feelin' Dusty because her metanarrative role as "the
not-as-important one" tickles me immensely. Despite originally being envisioned
as a way to backfill the flashback/present day chapter structure and flesh out
the setting and Lou's character, the maid chapters have ended up introducing
some extremely important charactersâ€”Sleeves is pivotal in Act 2, Chiffon is a
crucial emotional support for Lou and looks to be increasingly relevant in Act
3, even the at-the-time-unnamed guard who stumbled upon Lou in the halls has
gone on to be the storied Soixante Douze.

But not Dusty! Sleeves and Chiffon both know Lou's secret, but not Dusty.
Sleeves and Chiffon have both left the city to seek adventure, but not Dusty.
Dusty just stays Dusty. She's the archetypal friend in the group who's kind of
out of the loop, doesn't really participate in the group chat, but who
everyone's glad to see during the reunions. Dusty abides. And I love her for
that.
