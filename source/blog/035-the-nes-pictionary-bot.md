  <p>In early 2024, I spent a couple of afternoons digging up old code, putting together a new renderer, and getting everything in place. Rust code would extract the game’s drawings, render them as SVGs, and produce a JSON manifest file, while posting to Cohost would be handled in Python using valknight’s <a href="https://github.com/valknight/Cohost.py" target="_blank">Cohost.py</a>. I teased the bot’s existence with a screenshot of the game’s infamous DRAINPIPE glitch puzzle, and a day later on February 14<sup>th</sup>, <a href="https://cohost.org/lunasorcery/post/4473845-span-style-font-si" target="_blank">it went live</a>.</p>
  <p>I’d also snuck a few custom-made easter eggs into the pool of drawings — I <em>had</em> to include a few renditions of eggbug, the Cohost mascot, after all.</p>

Luna wrote up a really nice post about her NES Pictionary bot that covers both
the implementation and the place it held in Cohost's heart. I never engaged with
the bot much, but I enjoyed seeing it reblogged onto my feed with funny
captions, so it's lovely to hear a more thorough account of its history and see
some of the most impressive user submissions.

I think Luna made the right choice letting the bot end with the site. It was
part of the fabric there in a way it couldn't be elsewhere. Good night, sweet
robo-prince.
