  <p>The classic box fan CR-Box was invented during the COVID-19 pandemic and is THE most cost effective method to clean the air. They have <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132322011507">been shown</a> to be remarkably effective and outperforming most commercial HEPA filters on the market. It can also be scaled up as there have been many CR box builds where entire schools came together to provide one per classroom.</p>

This article is legitimately helpful, but I'm mostly posting it because I find
it extremely amusing that (at least as of a year ago) the best-in-class air
filter by cost and among the best overall is literally just taping a bunch of
filters to a box fan yourself. Hilarious _and_ easy on your wallet! But what's
even funnier is Joey's #1 recommendation:

  <h1>1. PC Fan Corsi-Rosenthal Box</h1>

  <p>The PC fan CR box was a recent invention to find a method to achieve high clean air delivery rates with very low noise. Noise is the greatest limitation of in-room air cleaners and PC fans are the best option to address it. There are no other air cleaners on the market that have the capability to supply 150 lps of clean air at 35 dBA. <strong>Nothing comes close.</strong></p>

The only thing better than than taping a bunch of filters to a box fan? Taping
them to a bunch of PC fans instead! Granted the ones linked here are a _little_
more sophisticated than that, but elsewhere on his site Joey presents one that
absolutely is just fans and tape:
