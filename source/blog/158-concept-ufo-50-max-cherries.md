title: "concept: _UFO 50_ max cherries speed run"

Obviously "All Cherries" as a category is essentially infeasible due to games
like _Rail Heist_, _Rock On! Island_, and _Grimstone_ taking over on the order
of hours individually, but just choosing a subset of games feels very arbitrary.
So instead, maybe select a chunk of time arbitrarily (two hours? three?) and say
"the best run is the one that gets the most cherries within this time". That
way, if a given game gets a way faster strategy, it can be routed in; there's
also a lot of toothsome choice between which of the games you do or do not
include, maybe even with differences between runners
