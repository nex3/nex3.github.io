title: The MCCONAUGHAUPS
---

This weekend, a few friends embarked on a voyage of romance, adventure, and
discovery all from the comfort of our computer rooms. We came together to
achieve something that, to my knowledge[^1], has never been achieved before. We
experienced the MCCONAUGHAUPS: a two-day marathon of every 00s romantic comedy
that starred Matthew McConaughey.

[^1]: I have made no effort to acquire any knowledge of whether this has been
    done before.

The germ of the idea formed when I read somewhere that Matthew McConaughey,
today known for his dramatic roles on the big and small screen, had spent his
early stardom almost exclusively in chick flicks. It was, in fact, a conscious
attempt to flee this typecasting that led him to refuse further roles as
romantic leads beginning around 2010 and eventually through force of will mold
his career into what we know today.

Now, I have no *particular* affection for the man. I would say I hadn't thought
about him much at all prior to this event. But I do consider myself quite a fan
of the rom-com genre, and having watched only a single one starring him my
curiosity was piqued. What does it look like for a man to spend a decade in a
genre, and what does it take for him to swear it off completely afterwards? I
had to know.

I managed to talk a few friends into joining me, and together we trekked into
the unstoppable flood of affable grins and light Texan drawls that was the
MCCONAUGHAUPS. And now that it has come to a close, please allow me to present
you with the fruits of our excursion: a thoroughly-researched ranking of all six
of Matthew McConaughey's 00s rom-com feature films.

<li>

[_Tiptoes_]. A film whose existence is baffling, but not as baffling as the
choices that went into making it. This only *barely* counts as a rom-com to
begin with; only the first third of the film and the unwelcome sprinkling of
fart jokes through the rest of it are at all comedic, and the rest is a dour
drama about a man (McConaughey) who hates himself and his family. Glad I watched
this with friends because it would have been unbearable alone.

[_Failure to Launch_]. A deeply stupid film where one of the running gags is
that various animals bite Tripp (McConaughey) and then visibly chuckle to
themselves about it because he hasn't yet achieved inner harmony. Portrays him
as a layabout loser only to reveal halfway through the film that he was engaged
but his fiancée died six years ago(!) and he's been helping to raise her son(!!)
ever since. Dragged into watchability by Zooey Deschanel and Kathy Bates moving
mountains as secondary characters.

[_Fool's Gold_]. Barely a rom-com, this is more of an adventure movie with light
rom-com elements. Anodyne, overlong, and suffers tremendously from every black
character being a rapper-slash-murderer. Other than that, though, it's decent
enough.

[_Ghosts of Girlfriends Past_]. Silly, schlocky, but at the end of the day
pretty fun. Connor (McConaughey) is a huge asshole in a way that's not always
fun to watch, but everything around that is cute, and it pulls off the
_Christmas Carol_ schtick surprisingly well considering how far it diverges from
the canon.

[_The Wedding Planner_]. We begin to get into the ones of these that I would
actually describe as "good". The two leads (Jennifer Lopez and McConaughey) have
real chemistry here, and the writing is absolutely on fire for the first act.
The rest of the film suffers from some pacing issues, but it's still good fun.
This was also one of the first rom-coms I remember seeing as kid, so it has a
special place in my heart for that as well.

[_How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days_]. An actual delight. The leads are the same as
in _Fool's Gold_ (Kate Hudson and McConaughey), but they're given vastly better
material here and are really able to show their chops. The supporting cast is
also stellar, including Kathryn Hahn, Adam Goldberg, and Bebe Neuwirth. I'll be
honest: I kinda want to watch this again just writing about it. Even if the rest
of these were either mids or films I'd already seen, this alone made this
project worth doing.

Even with the middling average quality of the films, hanging out with friends
and shooting the shit is a lot of fun, and I may try to do something like this
again... at least, if I can find another concept that grabs my fancy.
