{% ask "Máxima", title: "Are you going to play Silent Hill 2 OG or Remake this halloween?" %}
  As good as the remake looks, it's made by an entirely different team
{% endask %}

Good question! For those unfamiliar, I've had a yearly tradition since 2021 of
playing a classic survival horror game each October, because I like themes. I've
played _Resident Evil_ (GameCube version), _Silent Hill_ (PlayStation version
which I think is the only one), and _Resident Evil 2_ (2019 remake) so far. This
year, as Máxima accurately recalls, I am planning to play _Silent Hill 2_.

Originally I thought I would obviously be playing the original, since the remake
was being made by Bloober Team whose horror output has not seemed particularly
great. But with this remake reviewing quite well, I did take some time to
consider it as a real possibility. Ultimately, particularly after consulting {%
mention "Christa" %} who has strong opinions about these sorts of things, I
decided to stick with the original.

Where I've found my interest in _Resident Evil_ as a series largely orgbiting
its mechanics and the use of game design to convey a notion of "horror", at
least in the first _Silent Hill_ much more of what I found compelling was
wrapped up in the story and atmosphere. That's much harder to preserve, let
alone elaborate on, in a remake. Even a really good remake made in 2024 will
still have 2024-era textures and mocap and movement. If I'm playing a game for
its vibe, I think I want the first time I play it to be with the original vibe.
