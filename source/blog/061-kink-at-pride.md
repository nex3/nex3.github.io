    <p>A pickup truck with the Delta airlines logo on the side, bedecked with
    rainbows and topped with an inflatable Delta plane. Several men are visible
    in the truck bed grinning and looking off to the side.</p>

  <p>“Smile,” Tom reminded me. “You’re going to be famous.”</p>

  <p>I looked up and saw people holding up their phones, filming us. “No…” I
  gasped. “…not on social media! We’ll be taken out of context!”</p>

  <p>“The context, darling, is that everyone on 4chan and Twitter is going to
  know that you’re my little bitch boy.”</p>

  <p>“It’s X now,” I grunted, and this time when he pounded into me so hard it
  felt like I couldn’t breathe, I deserved it.</p>

Cliff's written a viciously funny piece of satirical erotic fiction sending up
the discourse around the place of sexuality at pride. It's funny and it's hot
and you should for sure check it out if that's your jam. I think if more entries
in internet arguments were in the form of erotic fiction rather than angry
microposts the world would be a much better place.
