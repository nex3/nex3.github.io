0.75oz amber rum, 0.75oz white rum, 0.75oz blanco vermouth, 0.25oz dry cura√ßao,
1bsp grenadine {% endimage %}

The color on this ended up so intense that it kind of blew out my phone camera a
bit. I'd previously made this with dry vermouth and it was not very good, but
it's quite pleasant with the proper blanco, which is much sweeter than dry but
not as rich and tannic as sweet vermouth. I'm pretty sure the grenadine is here
mostly for color, so you'll either want to use Rose's for the bright red hue or
else leave it out entirely, since nice homemade grenadine tends to be brown like
the pomegranate molasses used to make it.
