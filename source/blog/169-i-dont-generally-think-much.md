I don't generally think much of the _Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney_ episode 5. Being written after the original trilogy, the plotting neither fits well into the arc of the rest of the game, nor can it affect the (already set in stone) plots of what comes after. A lot of what's compelling about the writing are the threads and evolving characterization across the cases, so without that animating force episode 5 has to fall back on overtly gimmicky one-off characters who just don't have that much depth.

But with all that said, it _has_ done a remarkable job of making me feel a visceral repulsion at the antagonist. So, bravo for that.
