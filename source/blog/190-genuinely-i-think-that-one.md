genuinely I think one of the best features of _Death Stranding_ is that you can
get likes from people and from NPCs and even from the little half-stillborn
fetus you carry on your chest, and in this unbelievably systems-dense game there
is absolutely no reward for it beyond the satisfaction of a job well done.

_and then on top of that_ in case you were getting too invested in them the game
has an entire class of enemies whose origin story is "they cared so much about
getting likes for deliveries that it drove them insane"
