    >the hundo club</a
  >, it got me fully back into wiki editing and data mining, and even after
  beating every nightlord numerous times and completing every character quest
  I'll still cheerfully hop into a run any time anyone asks. The only reason I'm
  marking this "completed" now is because I want to get this review out of my
  head and onto the web.</p><p>If you'll permit a digression, I deeply
  admire <em>Elden Ring</em>'s parsimony. It's a huge game made be a relatively
  small company who had largely made relatively small games up to that point,
  and it accomplishes that with an economy of design I consider admirable. I
  know people complain about the re-used bosses, but there are actually very few
  of the 165 that are true duplicates of one another. Instead, they add little
  variations here and there, pair them with other bosses for duo encounters, or
  ramp up the complexity of their abilities over the course of the game. The
  small dungeons are the same way: they take a limited set of shared components,
  then mix and match them in different novel ways. These raw materials are a
  palette of paints that they re-use and recombine over and over to paint the
  entire game.</p><p>Most large games work this way to some extent, but in
  <em>Elden Ring</em> the quality of the design at each point really shines
  through in large part because it <em>draws attention</em> to the patterns and
  repetitions. You know a catacomb is going to have imps or skeletons and some
  sort of clever trick, you know a watchdog is going to do some kind of
  elemental damage, you know a hero's grave is going to make you want to claw
  out your eyes. But you don't know exactly how—it sets up just enough
  expectations for it to be able to play with them and continue to surprise you
  throughout its massive length.</p><p>If <em>Elden Ring</em> is a painting
  and its palette, <em>Nightreign</em> is another artist picking up the same
  palette and painting something entirely different. It stands as much in the
  tradition of unofficial mods as it does the tradition of classic
  soulslikes—it's related to <em>Elden Ring</em> in more or less the same way
  <em>Defense of the Ancients</em> is related to <em>Warcraft III</em>. The
  nouns and verbs are largely the same, but the context in which they exist is
  completely different and utterly surprising. After spending more than a decade
  as industry trendsetters, carving out a new genre and driving other studios
  insane trying to match their success in it despite going against all
  conventional wisdom, From Software has now put out a game that is itself
  reacting to trends in the industry. Not only that, it's integrating two
  trends—battle royales and roguelikes—whose peak has largely come and gone.</p><p>What's
  truly astounding is how well it works. I had expected a game where you
  famously die to bosses over and over before you begin to get comfortable with
  them to fit poorly into a run-based mold, but the ability to be resurrected by
  allies or even wipe in some circumstances without losing your run makes even
  difficult bosses doable. The difficulty curve is spot-on, with each nightlord
  taking just enough runs to feel like the victory is an achievement without
  being a slog, given that they have a 35-minute runback. The character classes
  are interesting and varied, and although I have some design quibbles (Executor
  and Guardian both suffer from the core issue that waiting for an enemy to hit
  you is a huge opportunity cost when every second counts) I enjoy playing as
  almost all of them.</p><p>The routing shines brightest of all, though.
  This was always going to be a result of combining roguelike randomness with
  battle royale spacing considerations, but even after spending so many hours in
  the game each run still feels unique and compelling largely on the strength of
  how interesting it is to plot a course through the world. There's so much
  that's meaningful to react to—Can we take the nearby field boss at our current
  level? How many stonesword keys do we have? Which locations give us type
  advantages? When are we leveled enough to do the castle? Does anyone need a
  smithing stone? How valuable are towers for our team comp?—and all of it is
  complicated multiplicatively by the circle locations and the time anything
  takes.</p><p>(I will take a moment here to say: I have almost exclusively
  played this game multiplayer, on a voice call with friends. I'm sure the
  experience is deeply different if you're playing with two strangers and can't
  communicate outside of map markers and time-consuming gestures. I've also
  played a number of solo runs, but I expect my enjoyment of those is also
  influenced by reaping the benefits of my routing strategy brain trust. Reading
  through some of the popular negative reviews on here, that's my best guess as
  to why I'm so much more taken with this game than they are. I recommend
  playing with friends, and if we're friends, let me know and I'll hook you up
  with my squad.)</p><p>Coming on the heels of <em>Elden Ring</em> and its
  game-sized DLC, <em>Nightreign</em> is shockingly small. Even given its
  foundation of asset reuse, it uses only perhaps a third of the base game's
  bosses and leaves out most of its environments. It smells like a skunkworks
  project: something created by a small team on the cheap, possibly born out of
  a single creator's idea, let out into the world to see what the reception
  would be. We know that DLC is coming; whether it will evolve into something
  more live-service flavored remains to be seen, and presumably depends to a
  large degree on us.</p><p>For my part, I'm thrilled to see something like
  this exist. It's small, it's inexpensive, it's weird, and for all that the
  elevator pitch sounds like chasing trends the result is something that (like
  every game this studio releases) is wholly and unapologetically its own thing.
  I want more of that. I'd want more of that even if it
  <em>didn't</em> unexpectedly charm me. From Software resolutely forged their
  own strange path long before they hit it big, and with every new game they
  release I brace myself for the possibility that they've finally attained
  enough success that they no longer feel they can afford to be so
  idiosyncratic. But so far, the blow has not come, and for that I'm thankful.</p>
