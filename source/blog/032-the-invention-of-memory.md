  <p><span>I think most people stabilized their warped sense of time by other means.

They were able to interrupt the prolonged uncertainty that the pandemic had brought to all of our lives by erecting a finish line just in time for them to run through it. And as they ran through it, celebrating the fictional end of an arduous journey, they simultaneously invented a new </span><em>before</em><span>. This is the invention of memory.</span></p><p>The Pandemic became something temporally contained, its crisp boundaries providing a psychic safeguard to any lingering anxieties around the vulnerability and interdependence of our bodies that only a virus could show us. No longer did it threaten to erupt in their everyday lives, forcing cancellations and illnesses and deaths. It was, officially, part of The Past. And from the safety of hindsight (even if only an illusion), people began telling and re-telling the story of The Pandemic in ways that strayed from how it all actually went down. It was a way to use memory as self-soothing.</p>

This is an intense, touching piece on the way people's minds have been shaped by
the pandemic, and the way that shape is in turn determined by their—our—failure
*en masse* to handle the reality of the pandemic. It's another way of looking at
the same issues I was driving at in [COVID Denialism and Disability Justice],
and I similarly found it helpful to bring myself some calm (if not closure) to
the pain of seeing people act so heartlessly.
