- '"we know better now" no. we have forgotten the old lore'

my two hottest survival horror takes are:

* the "ink ribbon" style save economy is actually genius and totally changes the
  way the player approaches the game. it's a huge factor in what makes resource
  management so compelling in early *Resident*s *Evil*

* fixed camera angles are worth every bit of the awkwardness of tank controls
  and more. I've only just started playing *Silent Hill 2* and it's already
  going completely off the wall with the camera in a way that just wouldn't work
  if you had to adjust your heading every time it cut

neither of these should be in every game, or even every survival horror
gameâ€”*Silent Hill* never used ink ribbons because it's not really about the
resource mechanics in the first place and that's fine. but it's a tragedy that
they've completely exited the modern design lexicon
