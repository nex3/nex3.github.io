I love hot drink season. There's something so nice about serving someone a warm
drink that's so buttery it's almost a pastry. One recipe I found called for
1/2tsp butter which is just comically small. The one major flaw with this mix is
that it puts in all the water first, which makes it too cool by the time
everything's all mixed. If I were to make it again (and I will!) I'd mix all the
liquid ingredients separately, dissolve the syrup in half the water, mix the
two, and then add the last half of the water to get everything nice and toasty
for serving.

One cocktail book I have advocates for just shoving a red hot poker into the
glass and heating it that way, but I think that's a little too hardcore for me.
