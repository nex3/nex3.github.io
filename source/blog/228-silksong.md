  This is an impressive follow-up to <em>Hollow Knight</em> not just in that
  it's another very good game (absolutely not a guarantee from a developer with
  only one game under their belt, no matter how successful that game was), but
  in that it understands deeply what makes a game effective specifically as a
  sequel. It's a checkerboard of expectations met and subverted: the core logic
  of the combat and feel of movement is essentially the same, but the single
  most powerful tool in HK1—the downward aerial "pogo" attack—is dramatically
  harder to use. Even early game bosses often do 2 masks of damage, but Hornet
  can heal three masks at a time. The familiar spell mechanic is back (renamed
  "skills" but otherwise identical) but it's augmented with equippable weapons
  that use a totally new economy.<br /><br />The result is a game that presents
  the player, from the moment they first try platforming with the new diagonal
  aerial attack, with a potent cocktail of familiarity and challenge. This
  proved too much for players who expected their skill at HK1 to automatically
  make them excellent at <em>Silksong</em>, but it's excellent design. A new
  game <em>should</em> challenge old players, and when those challenges subvert
  the best play patterns in the first game, they increase the challenge more for
  experienced players than they do for players who (perhaps boldly) pick up
  <em>Silksong</em> as their first entry in the series.
  <em>Silksong</em> demands that the player adapt to new styles of movement and
  resource economies, but at its heart it's still a game about careful
  positioning and weaponized acrobatics.<br /><br />So, is it hard? Not really.
  For all the hullabaloo on release about how difficult <em>Silksong</em> is,
  the main difference between its main quest bosses and <em>Hollow Knight</em>'s
  are that the early-game bosses are somewhat harder, which is about what one
  would expect from a sequel. Once you get past the first few intro bosses, you
  end up at around the level of HK1 bosses in similar positions like Mantis
  Lords, Soul Master, and of course our very own Hornet. Even the optional
  bosses are mostly pretty straightforward, with only a couple exceptions. The
  mandatory platforming is a little more difficult across the board than HK1, in
  part because of the less forgiving pogo and a larger suite of movement
  mechanics, but there's no single sequence mandatory or optional that comes
  close to the sustained difficulty of Path of Pain. If anything, I wish there
  were a bit more difficulty in the game, and I'm hoping the DLC will provide
  that.<br /><br />What people are complaining about, when it comes down to it,
  is that the game demands they break out of their comfort zone. And it makes
  some sense! The most diehard <em>Hollow Knight</em> players have been building
  their mental model of what being good at <em>Hollow Knight</em> entails
  unhindered for eight years. Every <em>Hollow Knight</em> DLC introduced new
  challenges that tested the same skills but harder. <em>Silksong</em> asks for
  more, or at least for a reframing of the way players think about the game.<br /><br />Nowhere
  is this clearer than in the removal of the Shade Cloak, and with it the
  elimination of almost any form of invulnerability-frame evasion in the game.
  By volume, this wasn't a huge part of the base game—it's an ability you only
  get in the postgame, so the bulk of the fights you face won't involve it at
  all. But the postgame fights and many of the DLC fights, which is to say
  generally the most difficult fights in the game, are built with the
  expectation that you'll be able to occasionally dodge right through an attack.
  <em>Silksong</em> has no such expectation, and I think that's tremendously to
  its credit even as it drives experienced <em>Hollow Knight</em> players
  mad.<br /><br />Removing the expectation that players can regularly dodge
  through the attacks of postgame bosses makes the design and play of those
  fights vastly more interesting. Dodging attacks through careful positioning
  brings all the game's movement mechanics to bear in fights, and is what makes
  the marriage of platforming and action combat so successful. Combined with the
  substantial wider diversity of directionality in <em>Silksong</em>'s attacks
  relative to the base game, it gives fights the potential to be very deep
  puzzles about how to most effectively deal damage without taking it. This is
  all inherent in <em>Hollow Knight</em> as well, but the Shade Cloak offered a
  safety valve for players to avoid engaging with it in exactly the fights where
  it was most compelling. <em>Silksong</em> is richer for its absence, and I
  think this particularly speaks to Team Cherry's maturing understanding of
  what's effective about their own design.
