Playing _Resident Evil 3: Nemesis_[^1] and once again mourning the total absence of tank controls from the modern design palette. They're not for everything but they work _so_ well for horror where having imperfect control over movement brings that feeling of fumbling around and panicking, and where giving the designer tight control of the camera provides so much juice. When you're walking down a hall and you can't see what's ahead of you it's scary!

[^1]: Four years ago, having never played a single game from either of the classic survival horror series, I decided to inaugurate myself a little October tradition: every year I play a _Resident Evil_ or a _Silent Hill_, alternating series, from the oldest forward. This is, of course, a _Resident Evil_ year.
