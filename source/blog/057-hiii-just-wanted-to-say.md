  HIII just wanted to say thank you for bringing h-entry to my attention! I've added it to my own static blog generator and, by extension, [my blog](https://tilde.town/~slimelia/pages/h-entry%20support.html)! there's so many things out there in the world you just never know about and would never stumble upon without someone going "hey look at this cool thing"
{% endask %}

hell yeah glad to see more people doing it! consider also annotating your
`p-author` with an [`h-card`](https://microformats.org/wiki/h-card) so you can
provide an avatarâ€”I had to pull this one manually from your tumblr
