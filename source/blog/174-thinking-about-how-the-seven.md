commentary:
- I guess this fits the general pattern where xtianity is all about what you think
- whereas eg judaism is way more about what you do

thinking about how the seven deadly sins from everyone's favorite oppressive global religion are all just... feelings? they're not even *actions you can take*. like "sin" in the xtian sense is a horrible concept any way you slice it but specifically emphasizing *occurrent emotions* as damning your soul to an eternal torture realm is next level fucked up
