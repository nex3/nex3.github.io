title: Seattle Cohost Wake
tags: [cohost, seattle]
commentary:
- thank you all again for coming out
- and for being on cohost
- and for sharing this moment with me and one another
---

As soon as [it was announced] that Cohost was shutting down, I knew I at least
needed some way to grieve it in community. I'm not a particularly observant Jew,
but I do take to heart the idea that grief is a community experience. Cohost was
never an experience of any individual in isolation, so its loss shouldn't be
experienced in isolation either.

[it was announced]: https://cohost.org/staff/post/7611443-cohost-to-shut-down

I talked to {% mention 'my wife', name: 'Liz' %} and {% mention 'Xandra', name: 'Xandra Granade', nickname: 'xgranade', url: 'https://www.xgranade.com/', logo: 'https://stockroom.wandering.shop/accounts/avatars/109/604/192/683/321/627/original/9b735fdf5d0b6834.png' %}
who had also made some rumblings about some sort of meet-up, we decided on a
place and time, and I sent out [an open invitation]â€Ž[^1]. We knew Seattle was a
pretty big Cohost city, but based on the [Philly] and [Boston] turnouts we
expected maybe thirty to forty people.

The last dedicated count we got was fifty-eight, but people kept showing up
after that so I believe in the end we had **more than sixty attendees**. {%
mention "Lydia" %} even came up from the Bay Area,
shocking everyone there who knew her! I was completely blown away by this
incredible outpouring of love for Cohost.

It was an intensely emotional mix of mourning and joy. We had a moment of
silence for the loss of Cohost, we came together in a cheer of "Eggbug
Forever!", but most of all people just hung out and chatted. We even had our
very own rainbow:

{% mention "Rose" %} and I also came up with an idea for a
little [local mailing list] for COVID-safe events. To help spread the word, we
made a zine. I only printed fifty copies, which I thought would be _plenty_, so
for anyone who showed up after all the zines were gone or who couldn't make it
at all, I've reproduced it below:

    important:

    **not just for cohost alums!**
    
    We want to preserve the spirit of Cohost and use that community as the seeds
    of something new, but there aren't any Cohost users anymore. Let's spread
    that spirit throughout the city and help thaw the Seattle freeze!

    **All events must be COVID-safe!**
    
    * All events must require N95+ masks
    * Indoor events must require negative rapid test within 12 hours
    * Need masks and tests? Mask Bloc has your back!
      <https://linktr.ee/maskblocseattle>
    * Don't attend if you've had COVID in the last two weeks or had confirmed
      COVID contact in the last week

    Be safe!\
    Be smart!\
    Support your disabled friends!

    **Moderation policy**
    
    For now, we're using Cohost's community guidelines where relevant: abuse,
    harassment, racism, homophobia, transphobia, and other bigotry will not be
    tolerated on the mailing list or at events advertised on the mailing list.
    
    We also reserve the right to ban people for being huge jerks, but we hope
    not to have to!

I want to thank everyone who came and made this event as wonderful as it was.
Now when I grieve Cohost, I'll be able to hold this evening as a balm to my
heart. To send it off, here are a few of the particularly adorable Eggbugs I
managed to photograph while I was there:

[^1]: I think this post actually coined "Cohost Wake". It was certainly the
      first in that tag!
