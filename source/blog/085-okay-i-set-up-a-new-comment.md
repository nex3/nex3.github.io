Okay I set up a new comment system! Shouts out to {% mention 'Damien' %} for
hosting it. It's definitely better than CommentBox: it's got real formatting,
you can change your avatar, and you can link back to your homepage.

The catch is that CommentBox didn't actually include commenter emails in its
data export, so you won't be able to update your old comments by default. If you
want to do so, send me an email at ask@nex-3.com with a link to one of your old
comments and I'll manually reset the email associated with that account so you
can go through the password recovery flow.
