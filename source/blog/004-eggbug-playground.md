This is the first of probably a number of my posts that I'm directly porting
from my Cohost. This was, to my knowledge, the first "CSS crime" on the site.
I made it when I realized how broad the set of inline styles the site allowed,
and this was the cleverest thing I could think to do with it. Others would
quickly outstrip me, but I'm very pleased to have opened the floodgates.
