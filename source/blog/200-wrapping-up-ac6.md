I've beaten _Armored Core VI_, all the way through the third loop. I've S-ranked
every mission, and then I went back and S-ranked a bunch of them _again_ to get
better recordings. I have every piece of equipment, every combat log, every OS
upgrade. Although my fingers haven't given up their itch for it, I can't justify
playing this game anymore when so many other games are sitting on my virtual
shelf, so I'm putting it away. For now.

As I always do with FromSoft titles, I've recorded my major accomplishments.
They're available for anyone who's interested in two different playlists:

* [My boss fights], including AC fights that felt major enough to be worth
  including. These are all official story mission victories in the order I did
  them in my three loops through the game.

* [My S ranks], in the order they appear in the game. If you're struggling to
  S-rank a specific mission, this may help you out.

I had five different Armored Cores I rotated through for the S ranks, largely
based on my experimentation during the main game:

My go-to mech. Double `SG-027 ZIMMERMAN` shotguns are already a cliché but
they're so much fun I can't bring myself to care. They force you to prioritize
getting in close, hitting quick, and punishing hard. The digitigrade legs allow
for huge quick boosts to get out of dodge fast if the enemy starts a melee
attack or an AOE, plus it gives a great kick with a long hitbox—crucial for
punishing staggers during this build's long reload windows.

This is a terrific boss-killer and one-on-one battler. Its biggest downsides are the relative lack of long-range options for mob-heavy missions and the low ammunition which makes it ill-suited for long-haul S-ranks.

A relatively minor variation on `FLAUMPTCH`, with two `Vvc-760PR` plasma rifles
taking the place of the shotguns and some tweaks to handle the added energy
burden and give better long-range tracking. What this lacks in one-on-one
stopping power it makes up for in its ability to absolutely mow down MTs and
other weak enemies. The plasma rifles have good range and a long-lasting AOE
when they land, so they can one-shot all but the toughest mobs.

I use this for missions where the bulk of the fighting is with random smaller
enemies, or where I need a good amount of reach. It's great for "tower defense"
style missions and some of the trickier "mop up the random MTs" missions where
waiting for a shotgun or a missile reload for each enemy is just not practical.
It struggles mightily to build up ACS damage against bosses and ACs, so look
elsewhere if you want to bring down larger prey.

I'll be honest: when I first saw flamethrowers in AC6, I thought they couldn't
possibly be any good. They do negligible ACS damage, they can't knock around or
stagger the enemy, and you have to keep them close for ages to do anything.

I was wrong. _Flamethrowers fuck._

`WB-0000 BAD COOK` puts out a tremendous amount of damage over time for very
little ammunition cost. It'll pop MTs like bugs in the microwave and can quickly
overpower the incredibly annoying shield guys that show up in later missions.
Yes, it'll probably soak up some damage while it's cooking, but the stun needles
on the shoulders will put all but the most hardy ACs down for a long and toasty
nap.

I used `MAILLARD` to S-rank missions that involved multiple AC encounters and
especially those where I was outnumbered, since it's so effective at simply
burning away anything in its path. It's probably good enough to make it through
more or less the whole game—like `FLAUMPTCH`, its biggest weakness is the short
range of its main hand weapons, but the `VE-60SNA`s on the shoulders reload
surprisingly fast and can probably handle most ranged needs.

A specialized mech for some specialized needs. I only used this for a few S
ranks, because it has exactly one pattern: it stuns enemies with the `VE-60SNA`
stun needle launchers, then blows them to high hell with its `DIZZY` grenade
launchers. The grenades take a metric eternity to reload, so you'd better finish
your business the first time or be prepared to dodge and weave a bit while you
wait.

I'm not generally a fan of tank builds (as you can see from the mechs I've
built), but grenade launchers turn out to weigh in pretty heavy so it was
unavoidable. Thankfully, the missions I sent this demolition expert on required
minimal verticality and a fair amount of raw ground speed so the bite-sized
`EL-TL-11 FORTALEZA` treads ended up being a good fit anyway.

I used this mech for exactly one Loop 3 mission, a real nasty one where I needed
a specific combination of extremely long range, quick reload speed, medium-high
damage, good vertical movement, and a serious energy capacity. If you've played
the mission, you know which one I mean.

This is not a general-purpose mech. It doesn't do a lot of ACS damage, which
doesn't matter because it has no way to punish a stagger other than a swift kick
to the head. It's got terrible short-range stats but other ACs move too much to
get a lot of hits in long range. It is purpose built for exactly one thing:
sniping mobs. And for that, it's excellent.
