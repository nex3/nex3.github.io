    Welles's absolute, undeniable stage presence is on full display. He makes
    himself huge physically, visually, and emotionally, and then spends the
    entire film toppling himself, playing both roles of Jack and the giant. This
    is a film about a man full of bluster and bonhomie who, despite being
    superficially well-liked by all around him, continually pushes their
    tolerance to the breaking point, needling them, sapping their patience and
    their wallets even as he makes them laugh uproariously. Falstaff is good
    friends with all who meet him but never quite truly beloved by any, and when
    he finally acts upon presumption of that love he is utterly destroyed.

    Knowing that Welles identified so personally with Falstaff, went to such
    great lengths to make this film happen, and even said that this role was his
    life's work makes its function as self-critique to the point of
    self-destruction all the more pointed. Fallstaff lies baldly and constantly,
    and we know from F for Fake that Welles saw his own role as a liar and
    charlatan; this film suggests that as much as those lies were an intrinsic
    part of himself, they were also a source of grief. Orson Welles, a man who
    always presented himself as larger than life, in this film where he is at
    his largest is also at his most exposed, raw, and vulnerable.
