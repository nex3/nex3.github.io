has anyone written a Batman fic where Bruce actually goes to therapy, works through his trauma in a healthy and productive way, starts putting his fortune to work tackling structural issues, eventually realizes that while the Batman persona was borne of trauma and maladaptive coping mechanisms there's a part of it he still loves and identifies with and wants to find a way to embody more positively, and then the punchline is that the whole thing is a prologue to _Batman_ (1966)?
