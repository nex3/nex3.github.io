    The film sets up a dichotomy between the inorganic—the ship and its reactor
    filled with ornamentation we are to assume is all for the realization of
    profit, contrasted with its intensely human (and feline) crew. The
    gorgeously-rendered hull of the ship acts as a prison and its corridors
    restrict the possibilities of its inhabitants. And yet, among the first
    thing we hear from this crew is the seeds of organization, of raging against
    their imprisonment.
  </p>
  <p>
    But as soon as the film establishes this dichotomy, it begins to play with
    it. The titular alien's nest is an organic mockery of the ship, and once the
    xenomorph is aboard the Nostromo it begins to cut (literally) through the
    metal and plastic bonds, the hyperorganic coming to dominate the machine.
    Eventually, the crew itself begins taking action against the machine in
    self-defense but from it and from their pursuer.

  <p>
    Ripley as a character becomes elaborated along with this dichotomy. Although
    she's quiet at first, not one of the crew who draws attention in the first
    few scenes, the more we see from her the clearer her values become. She
    holds life in the highest esteem, even that of Jones the cat. In doing so,
    she stands in opposition to the "purity" of force represented by both the
    Nostromo and the xenomorph. In her, we see that purity is intrinsically a
    false goal—the true value is always in the impurities that make us people.
