I feel a little less dire about the films of 2025 than I do about [the games],
but only a little. There are no films I found outright repulsive, which is a win
I suppose, although I do feel like I'm still inhabiting the hater spirit in
being relatively cool on films that sent people at large into raptures.
[_Sinners_] was undeniably cool, but it was also unfocused, lacking in the
clarity of purpose that's necessary to make a truly excellent film about
supernatural horrors. [_One Battle After Another_] is principled in a shockingly
impressive direction, but doesn't quite land the plane on its ambitions. [_Wake
Up Dead Man_] is an excellent whodunit, but the writing and characterization
around that ends up cartoonish as often as it is profound.

The other sad fact of this year is that there's no film from it that hit me hard
enough that I have it a full five stars. I do try to be conservative about
giving out my highest possible rating, but despite that I've watched multiple
five-star films each year all the way back through 2021. Worse still, looking
back through the films that came out this year and my friends' reactions to
them, I don't know if there's anything that's even *plausible* that I would love
wholeheartedly.

This has been a grim year in a lot of ways, and an infertile media landscape is
hardly the worst of it. But it's also hard to say that the two are unrelated.
How can you separate the systematic evisceration of life through genocide and
culture through LLMs from the faltering of art itself? I suppose, if there's a
silver lining to be had, it's that this ignites in me the fire to create things
of beauty myself. And I can only hope I'm not the the only one.

## Film of 2025: [_Frankenstein_]

I'm not universally a fan of Guillermo del Toro's work, although I'm always a
fan of the way he thinks about and articulates his relationship to art.
_Frankenstein_, though, hit for me in a way that nothing he's made has since
_Pacific Rim_. It thoroughly embodies his philosophies of creation, perhaps
because it's _about_ creation. I also can't deny the influence on me from the
large volume of quotes and making-of shots that I saw on Tumblr—getting into the
artist's head doesn't always help make the art more compelling, but in this case
it worked wonders.

The other thing that boosts this to the top spot, of course, is the lack of
competition. The only other film that I gave the same rating was [_Naked Gun_],
which I do heartily appreciate as a proper comedy that refuses the tyranny of
the deadpan. But ultimately the craftsmanship of _Frankenstein_ won out for me
over the exuberance of _Naked Gun_.

[_Naked Gun_]: https://letterboxd.com/nex3/film/the-naked-gun/

It's not lost on me that these two are an adaptation and a remake, as I was
bemoaning in my post on games as well. _Wake Up Dead Man_ is a sequel, and
_Bugonia_ is another remake. I think the best wholly original film I saw was
_Marty Supreme_, and even that feels like it exists in the shadow of _Uncut
Gems_ despite not being a sequel as such. I want to escape this spiral of
endless reproductions and imitations. Is it too much to ask for something both
new *and* excellent?

## Films of the Years

This is truly where I have experienced the most unbridled joy in art this year.
I watched 215 films this year, which is down from my all-time high in 2024 but
still the second most of any year I've been keeping track. Most of these films
I'd never heard of before. Many of them I loved, with a substantial amount of
overlap between the two categories. And even of those I didn't love, I usually
found something to appreciate. Even in bad film, there are elements of its time
and its perspective that are fascinating to dive into. And as a result, there
has been a considerable amount of change to my list of films of the years:

* 1942: _Casablanca_. With this year's watch of _Cat People_, I finally hit the
  five-film minimum necessary to add 1942 to my list. _Cat People_ itself may be
  kind of dire, but _Casablanca_ is the source of every quote you've ever heard
  for a reason.

* 1945: [_Brief Encounter_]. This was actually the first film I watched in 2025!
  Between it and _Mildred Pierce_, 1945 is now in play, and the former film
  takes it handily with its bittersweet romance and stalwart commitment to
  avoiding cliché.

  [_Brief Encounter_]: https://letterboxd.com/nex3/film/brief-encounter/

* 1952: [_Limelight_] brings 1952 onto the board with a bang. I haven't watched
  much Chaplin at all, and I certainly didn't expect to see him (and Buster
  Keaton!) put up such a stunning dramatic performance. This film was such a
  surprising joy when I watched it year and I'm glad to be able to feature it on
  the list.

  [_Limelight_]: https://letterboxd.com/nex3/film/limelight/

* 1954: [_Rear Window_]. Either of _Carmen Jones_ and _On the Waterfront_ would
  have allowed me to bring this onto the list, and so have the whole of the
  1950s represented. And what a film for it: _Rear Window_ is my personal
  favorite Hitchcock, an absolute _tour de force_ of cinematic technique and
  gripping plot. It's actually been a few years since I watched it, and I might
  need to concoct an excuse to watch it again...

  [_Rear Window_]: https://letterboxd.com/nex3/film/rear-window/

* 1966: [_The War Game_] replaces _Daisies_. A truly magnificent piece of
  agitprop, you can feel the palpable desperation in _The War Game_ to get
  through to the average viewer about the unspeakable horror that a nuclear war
  would represent. While I enjoy and respect _Daisies_ a lot, it's not nearly as
  profound nor as intense as this semi-documentary horror story.

  [_The War Game_]: https://letterboxd.com/nex3/film/the-war-game/

* 1970: [_The Conformist_]. I'm shocked it took me so long to fill out 1970, by
  far the latest year I hadn't seen five films from, a dubious honor that has
  now fallen all the way back to 1947. I watched _The Conformist_ in 2024
  (_Colossus: The Forbin Project_ and _Count Yorga, Vampire_ were the films that
  finally filled out the quota), but I consider it a truly magnificent piece of
  post-fascist cultural introspection.

  [_The Conformist_]: https://letterboxd.com/nex3/film/the-conformist/

* 1975: [_Jeanne Dielman_] replaces [_Mirror_]. Look, I think very highly of
  _Mirror_. Tarkovsky giving himself wholly to abstraction is a marvelous thing.
  But I don't (yet) feel like I totally understand _Mirror_, whereas _Jeanne
  Dielman_ became an immediate and undeniable presence in my artistic
  consciousness the moment I watched it (on a cinerama screen no less!). I may
  go back on this opinion again once I get around to watching _Mirror_ a few
  more times, but for now this is my pick.

  [_Jeanne Dielman_]: https://letterboxd.com/nex3/film/mirror/
  [_Mirror_]: https://letterboxd.com/nex3/film/mirror/

* 1993: [_Trois couleurs : Bleu_] replaces _Groundhog Day_. A slam dunk
  replacement if there ever was one. _Groundhog Day_ is fun and shockingly
  savvy, but _Trois couleurs_ as a whole is a masterpiece and _Bleu_ is my
  favorite of the three by a comfortable margin. Just tremendous.

  [_Trois couleurs : Bleu_]: https://letterboxd.com/nex3/film/three-colours-blue/

* 2007: [_Michael Clayton_] replaces _Hot Fuzz_. This year, _Michael Clayton_
  came to me like a cold drink in the desert. I watched it in December, as I was
  beginning to rotate in my mind the ideas that I would express in these posts,
  which is to say: as I was beginning to truly despair at the quality of art as
  a whole. To see a film so pristine, not even an art film as such but a
  thriller executed to perfection, did a lot to remind me that good art could
  exist and would again.

  [_Michael Clayton_]: https://letterboxd.com/nex3/film/michael-clayton/

* 2024: [_Challengers_] replaces [_I Saw the TV Glow_]. It's not often that I
  replace the previous year's entry the very next year, let alone with something
  that I did in fact watch in the year it was released! I do still stand by my
  choice of _I Saw the TV Glow_ as my [2024 film of the year], but it was by a
  razor-thin margin at the time and through the course of 2025 _Challengers_ was
  the film that danced around my mind the most. I want these lists to be living
  documents more than records of years past; I already have blog archives and
  Letterboxd history for archives of years past! Today, going into 2026,
  _Challengers_ is my film of 2024. Perhaps next year it will be something else
  entirely.
