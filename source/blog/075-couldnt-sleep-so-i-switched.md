couldn't sleep so I made the long overdue switch from NewsBlur to [Inoreader](https://inoreader.com/) tonight. it's way better in every way *except* the way it handles email newsletters is substantially worse than what NewsBlur and Feedbin do. it requires a separate email for every feed, which is a massive pain in the ass if you're subscribed to forty patreons and you want a different feed for each one

**Edit:** augh actually it doesn't display feed tags either. that's actually a serious problem for me. fuck
