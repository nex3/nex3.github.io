  Having played only two <em>Silent Hill</em> games, I've already formed my
  opinion that <em>this</em> is what <em>Silent Hill</em> should be. Although
  the original marshaled an incredible ambiance, it didn't quite manage to
  coalesce it into cogent themes. It lives in my memory largely as a collection
  of horror vignettes which, while strikingly effective given the limited
  palette of the PS1, are little more than the sum of their parts.<br /><br /><em

  learns that lesson well, and strides forth confidently with a degree of
  narrative focus and aptitude that's rare to see in games before or since.
  Everything in this town of Silent Hill curls meticulously around its true
  function, even long before the player begins to suspect that it has a function
  at all. Where the first game just asks the player to experience it, the second
  asks the player to <em>understand</em> it, and is consistent enough to truly
  reward that understanding. In doing so, it manages to be effective not just as
  a game or as a mood poem but as a horror story—something I've never seen
  another game fully succeed at.<br /><br />The craftsmanship is also
  outstanding even beyond the purely narrative realm. When I first played
  <em>Resident Evil</em> (2002) I was shocked by how much mileage it got out of
  its much-derided "tank controls" as a means of giving the game itself detailed
  control over the camera angles without bewildering the player's movement.
  <em>Silent Hill 2</em> takes this to the next level, allowing the movement of
  the player itself to guide the camera along paths that echo those of horror
  cinematography. My breath was stolen when, in the opening sequence as James
  walks down a long dirt path through the woods, the camera began trailing him
  with trees interspersed, using filmic techniques to convey a sense of being
  watched and stalked.<br /><br />It's just not possible to do that sort of
  things with the now-standard two-stick full-motion camera controls, and I
  became even more thoroughly convinced playing this game that we let ourselves
  throw away a gem of design in tank controls. They do feel awkward, this I
  won't deny—but must games always feel smooth? What is life without a little
  variation in the texture? I dearly hope that one day fixed cameras and
  relative controls are added back to the toolbox of game design, as I long to
  see what a game could do if it truly iterated on the way
  <em>Silent Hill 2</em> wields the camera as a piece of the artistry during the
  game itself.<br /><br />The only place this doesn't rise above its predecessor
  are the combat and resource management mechanics, which still feel by-the-book
  relative to <em>Resident Evil</em>'s brilliance. The combat is perhaps
  slightly better here, but only by virtue of being easier to avoid. But if the
  niche this series is carving for itself is tremendous atmosphere, narrative,
  and visual artistry, you won't hear a single complaint from me.
