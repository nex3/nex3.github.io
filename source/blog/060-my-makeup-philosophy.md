  <p>when i was younger, i was honestly pretty disinterested in makeup and fashion trends. i found it alienating; i did not fit in with what was popular among the youth of my assigned gender. and i think i knew that it was a futile effort to even attempt fitting in. no, i knew i was a little weirdo who felt infinitely more comfortable hiding behind a computer screen.</p>

  <p>but there was one day where i was at the local drugstore, and i made a shortcut through the makeup section to get to the pharmacy. something caught my eye. it was a display of eyeshadow quads, all featuring different color palettes. and i stopped for a moment, curious about the color combinations. color theory was already a pretty big interest of mine at that point; i had been doing a ton of limited color palette drawing exercises, and the quads on display reminded me of the palettes i'd use for practice.</p>

I really appreciate tulip's articulation of their approach to makeup as an art
rather than an attempt to meet impossible beauty standards. I'm always compelled
by ways to consciously produce art in places that aren't generally thought of as
sites for art, and tulip has a particularly interesting perspective coming to
makeup from a painting background. I haven't worn anything beyond lipstick and
the occasional eyeliner in years, but this has inspired me to consider breaking
out the eyeshadow palette again...
