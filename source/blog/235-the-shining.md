      I came into this viewing kind of prepared to be underwhelmed. My
      recollection of this was of a visually striking film that was pulling in
      too many directions at once to really land thematically, kind of a collage
      of vibes and imagery that just swirls around without landing anywhere. But
      this watch made me feel like there was actually more there than I was
      giving it credit for.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think a lot of the sense of disjointedness i inherited from the book.
      They clearly wanted to keep the title, which means keeping the concept of
      "shining" and Tony. But it all feels superfluous in the context of the
      film's orientation around Jack rather than Danny. It's really only
      relevant in motivating Danny's interactions with Dick Halloran—a character
      who himself is done pretty dirty, existing only to explain the titular
      shining, deliver a warning about room 237, bring a means of escape, and
      then die instantly upon setting foot in the hotel. I can't help but feel
      that a story less chained to the novel could have restructured all of this
      into something more interesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do think Kubrick and Johnson made absolutely the right call in the way
      they framed Jack. The novel's more sympathetic portrayal (driven,
      reportedly, by King's own identification with the character) would
      undercut the ability to use the character to address patriarchy and abuse,
      and instead center the hotel as an ontologically evil place that corrupts
      indiscriminately. The darker, unsettlingly suave portrayal by Nicholson
      immediately raises red flags in his interactions with his wife and kids,
      and sets up a clear implication that his cruelty isn't just the product of
      either alcohol or the Overlook.
    </p>
    <p>
      The film is pointedly full of internal contradictions, and one in
      particular stood out to me. In the initial interview scene, Jack acts as
      though he has no knowledge at all of the previous murders. But not only
      does he identify Grady's ghost by sight, he specifically mentions having
      seen him *in the newspaper*, suggesting he was following the killings at
      the time and had known about them for years. We can then read his seeking
      employment at the Overlook as, in essence, a willing first step towards
      violence. Perhaps the hotel called to him, but he chose to answer that
      call.
    </p>
    <p>
      This then helps clarify the rest of the film. Jack Torrance isn't a
      flawed-but-fundamentally-innocent man being seduced by pure evil, he's a
      man who before the film ever began had fully bought into the patriarchal
      system that told him he must be an effortlessly brilliant writer and any
      roadblocks must be caused by his useless wife (whom we see not only
      cooking bountiful meals but doing Jack's actual job of maintaining the
      boilers) and his needy son. The Overlook doesn't corrupt him, it enables
      him. It provides the same background radiation white men have always
      experienced, just amplified: an understanding that he's always right, his
      actions are always justified, and that anything that pushes back against
      this worldview is an affront that must be destroyed with violence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hotel itself has its own interesting background that's simultaneously
      undersold and reinforced by the "Indian burial ground" cliché. The whole
      thing is conspicuously decorated in Diné weaving patterns despite the
      offhand mention that they "had to repel a few Indian attacks as they were
      building it". The only person of color we see in its walls is Dick
      Halloran, who the hotel ghosts refer to later on with a racial slur. It's
      a place of conquest: an imperial stronghold built on the literal bones and
      decorated with the cultural spoils of a people dominated and subdued. In
      its heyday, Stuart Ullman tells us, it hosted the presidents who oversaw
      this terrible empire and the (implicitly European) royalty from whose
      fetid stock the project of colonialism was born.
    </p>
    <p>
      We see this heyday with our own eyes, first in Jack's visit to the ghost
      bar and then in the famous final shot. In most ghost stories, the previous
      grisly murder is the seed of trauma that blooms into a full-scale
      haunting, but the roaring 20s loom too large in the Overlook to make it
      credible that Grady's massacre was the point of origin. Grady himself is
      subsumed into the party, the endless ghastly New Years celebration of the
      rich and powerful, to which he is consigned to the role of a mere waiter.
      In this way, the film cannily links imperialism and patriarchy: the party,
      dancing on the bones of a conquered people, flouting Prohibition with
      glasses held high, too powerful to be touched by the laws they impose on
      the plebians at their feet, is the bloodthirsty engine that drives the
      caretakers to their violent fates; and it does so by nurturing in them
      visions of this conquest in miniature, driving these working men to play
      out the same murderous and domineering triumph in the only space where
      they have any real power: the family.
