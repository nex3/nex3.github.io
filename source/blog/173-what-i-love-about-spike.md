What I love about Spike Buffythevampireslayer is that he perfectly encapsulated
everything great and terrible about the series and Whedon's writing in general.
He's a lot of fun and adds a tremendous amount to the main cast and also his
character is given some incredibly rapey stuff that's absolutely never addressed
at all. He has a really compelling character arc where he overcomes his vampiric
evil and becomes a true friend and ally to the protagonists, an arc that also
completely undermines the entire premise of the other major vampire character's
arc. I have a lot of affectionate nostalgia for the Spike era of Buffy in
particular but I will absolutely not ever go back and watch it because I just
can't stand everything that comes with.
