  Let me begin by saying: fuck Nintendo. Their insistence on ruining the lives
  of people who do anything they disapprove of with the products they sell,
  regardless of whether that thing is illegal let alone harmful to them, is
  despicable. It creates a chilling effect on vital efforts towards digital
  preservation that extends far beyond their own products, on top of just being
  a heinous thing to do to fans of their games. The regard in which they
  consistently hold their back catalog as assets on which they could one day
  collect rent speaks to a deep-rooted capitalistic mindset among the
  businessmen who run the company that is in no way outweighed by the positive
  things written below.<br /><br />All that said...
  <em>Welcome Tour</em> evinces an attitude somewhere in the company—somewhere
  widespread enough to get this game made and translated—that I find deeply
  admirable. Unlike the obvious touchpoint <em>ASTRO's Playroom</em>, this is a
  tour of the Switch 2 in the most thorough possible sense. It takes the player
  not just through the most charismatic features like HD Rumble 2 or the mouse
  control scheme, it shows off every square centimeter of the system in a very
  literal sense. Players walk across circuit boards and computer chips and learn
  about exactly what they do. Every meticulous design decision is laid out for
  the player to see.<br /><br />The result is a game that's intimately concerned
  with the physical and design structure of the device it's describing, and that
  invites the player to share in that concern. It trusts the player to care
  about the craftsmanship with which the console was created, and it provides
  tech demos to guide them towards understanding it by directly demonstrating
  technical concepts like framerate, HDR, and VRR.<br /><br />And, yes, this is
  in service of convincing buyers that the $450 or whatever they laid out for
  this device was worth it by framing it as a meticulously designed luxury
  product. But it's also taking a stand and saying that thoughtful, humanistic
  design is what defines quality. In an era when every corporate product is
  racing to become the worst version of itself that might still be salable, when
  overhyped prediction engines that can only produce statistically-average slop
  are hailed as the future of content, this is a dramatically heterodox position
  for Nintendo to stake out so stridently. I'm impressed and honestly heartened
  by it—not enough to look past the company's myriad acts of destruction, but
  enough to say that I'm very glad that <em>Welcome Tour</em> is the way it is.
