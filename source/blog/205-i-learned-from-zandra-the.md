I learned from {% mention 'Zandra' %} the other night that French basically does
not have a graceful way of expressing the equivalent of "fuck \<something>". It
has plenty of curse words but none of them function as a transitive word roundly
condemning something the way "fuck" does in English. It's just one of the
strengths of the languageâ€”although by contrast, French is evidently better at
stringing together a long series of curses.
