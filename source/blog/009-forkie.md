I added the ability to automatically pull down and embed Cohost posts. I just
paste the URL on its own line and my automation takes care of the rest (checking
it in so it doesn't need to make a separate request each time the build runs).
Hopefully this will be the first of many sites I do that with: I want to see if
I can integrate the notion of the Tumblr-style "reblog" with a more traditional
site-specific blog structure.

In celebration, please enjoy a post I still think back on and chuckle:
