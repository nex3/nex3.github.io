    This month's film is another lighthearted one that I suspect people may not
    have heard of. I ran across Jeffrey (1995) last year and I found it to be a
    charming and offbeat examination of the psychological fallout of AIDS. It's
    full of gleefully expressionistic directorial choices, and it's got Patrick
    Stewart playing an old gay interior decorator. It's a lot of fun!

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>What:</strong>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_%281995_film%29"
        ><em>Jeffrey</em></a
      >
    </li>
    <li><strong>When:</strong> 11AM on Sunday the 25th of May</li>
    <li>
      <strong>Where:</strong> The Beacon in Columbia City, 4405 Rainier Ave S.
      It's about a 15 minute walk from the Columbia City station, and the 7, 9,
      and 50 stop right outside the door.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>RSVP:</strong>
      <a href="https://partiful.com/e/lpKTgU8PcGyqUhh7fYzV?">At this link</a>!
      The theater seats 48, so we shouldn't run out of space, but please RSVP
      nevertheless!
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Price:</strong> If you can send $10 to
      <a href="https://account.venmo.com/u/nweiz">@nweiz on Venmo</a> to help
      keep these going, I'd appreciate it, but if you can't afford it please
      come anyway.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>COVID precautions:</strong> Please wear a mask (N95 or better) and
    run an over-the-counter test day-of or the night before. If you can't afford
    one,
    <a href="https://linktr.ee/maskblocseattle">Mask Bloc Seattle</a>
    can probably hook you up.
    <a href="https://outsidercomics.com/">Outsider Comics</a> in Fremont usually
    sells them at-cost as well. The theater will be selling concessions, but we
    ask that you eat them outdoors rather than during the film. The theater
    itself is not a masks-required space at other times, although we will be the
    first event of the day and I'll ask the person running the show to mask and
    test as well and I will be bringing a large portable air filter.
  </p>
  <p>Hope to see you there!</p>

So it turns out I fucked up the booking on this, and it's actually going to be
at 8PM. Sorry for the confusion and the short notice!
