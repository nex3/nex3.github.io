All I'm saying is that the first government to start funding grants for working
on the fun parts of software instead of betting on machine learning as the
be-all end-all is gonna have an incredible leg up on prestige and talent
acquisition when it comes to shaping the digital world over the next half
century. The USA's place as the center of software gravity isn't just eroding,
it's being purposefully gutted by short-sighted fools who think they can save
labor costs by farming out a medium that requires both creativity and precision
to machines that are fundamentally capable of neither. Jobs are scarce and
prestigious, fun jobs are scarcer. A huge orchard of talent is ripe for the
picking.

And I don't just mean funding grants for open-source libraries or public-service
web infrastructure or things like that (although they should do that too). I
mean fully _arts_ grants, blank checks to create experimental digital media,
video games, demoscene demos, wacky hardware, video game mods. Fund the stuff
that engineers do in their _spare time_ as long as they do it on your soil and
make it available in your language. Build goodwill, build local networks of
skill and renown, and you'll have a lock on the whole culture as America
continues to collapse.
