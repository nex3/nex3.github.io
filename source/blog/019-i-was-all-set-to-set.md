I was all set to set up a custom Tumblr scraper so I could reblog art and stuff
on here, but it turns out Tumblr already uses [the h-entry microformat] out of
the box! I don't have to do anything special at all! Except maybe to handle
reblog chains, but that's something I should really do anyway.

[the h-entry microformat]: /blog/reblogging-posts-with-h-entry
