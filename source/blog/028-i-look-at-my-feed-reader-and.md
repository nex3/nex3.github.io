    however. please üòÆ‚Äçüí® at me if i am only ever posting about computer or
    website. to lightly paraphrase something a friend pointed out‚Ä¶ the real
    tragedy of october 1 is that a lot more of the people who i will be seeing
    online in this way will be‚Ä¶ computer touchers. programmers. (although now
    that i say this: it would be interesting to do a little audit of my actual
    blogroll. because i can think of Several who are <em>not</em> this.)

I'm really happy to see a bunch of the less-technical people I followed on
Cohost setting up blogs with [Bear](https://bearblog.dev/) or
[Ghost](https://ghost.org/) or [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/). It's been
fun for me to set this site up as a playground for what could be possible as far
as bringing the aspects of social media I value to the web, but truly one of the
biggest virtues of social media sites is making it so so easy to get set up and
start posting. At the same time, it's also one of its biggest downfalls, because
it's the same thing that makes it so easy to get sucked into the quicksand of
corporate lock-in.
