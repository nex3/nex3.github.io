im gonna start a band making experimental music and we're gonna go on tour and the opener is gonna be a lecture series on the geological formation of mesas and similar structures and our fans are gonna love it all screaming and taking off their shirts for cliff-and-bench topography and then we're going to take the stage and play a single note for two straight hours cycling between forty-eight different instruments and by the time the audience gets home they will bear g flat in their very bones
