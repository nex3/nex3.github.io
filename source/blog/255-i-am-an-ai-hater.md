    And I’m glad they’re lies. Because the makers of AI aren’t damned by their
    failures, they’re damned by their goals. They want to build a genie to grant
    them wishes, and their wish is that nobody ever has to make art again. They
    want to create a new kind of mind, so they can force it into mindless
    servitude. Their dream is to invent new forms of life to enslave.

  <p>
    And to what end? In a kind of nihilistic symmetry, their dream of the
    perfect slave machine drains the life of those who use it as well as those
    who turn the gears. What is life but what we choose, who we know, what we
    experience? Incoherent empty men want to sell me the chance to stop reading
    and writing and thinking, to stop caring for my kids or talking to my
    parents, to stop choosing what I do or knowing why I do it. Blissful
    ignorance and total isolation, warm in the womb of the algorithm, nourished
    by hungry machines.

I'm a bit late to the party, but I was just linked Anthony Moser's poetic and
impassioned evisceration of LLMs today and I think anyone who hasn't yet read it
should do so. I cosign it as an articulation not just of my position on the
subject, but of my emotional stance towards it as well. The techno-cultural
nexus that we have recently taken to calling "artificial intelligence" is deeply
corrosive, and we must not tolerate it. We must not give it air to breathe. When
this all falls to an ignominious end, we must dance on its grave that it may
never rise again.
