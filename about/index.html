      <h1>About</h1>
<p>I'm Natalie and this is my little slice of online, an attempt to carve out an
alternative to social media that straddles the line between being being a blog
and approximating the joy I once took in posting on the late lamented [Cohost].
It is a personal site to achieve my personal ends. If you're looking for my
professional life, I'm sure you can find that elsewhere.</p>
<p>With this site, I'm trying to accomplish three broad goals:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Provide a single (curated) feed for my posts.</strong> At the very least, I need
somewhere to put my longer posts, and I would like it to be somewhere that's
not intrinsically beholden to VC money or likely to vanish if a single admin
burns out. Ideally, I would also like a place to cross-post the best posts I
make on other sites, such as <a href="https://letterboxd.com/nex3">Letterboxd</a> and <a href="https://www.backloggd.com/u/nex3/">Backloggd</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Provide a (curated) feed for posts I like.</strong> Something I think no social
media has gotten right since Google Reader is the ability to curate posts,
art, and other media <em>from across the web</em> with high-quality attribution and
additional commentary. I want that here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Provide a forum for conversation sparked by posts.</strong> This is the toughest
of all the goals, because it's social in addition to technical. The great
boon of social media sites is that people are already primed to interact when
they see a post. I can't reproduce that on my own, but I hope at least to be
able to make it possible to converse if people want to.</p>
</li>
</ol>
