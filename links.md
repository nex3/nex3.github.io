## Products and Services

  A panel from [Achewood](https://achewood.com/2004/02/03/title.html).

  **Roast Beef:** Why did you send a check for $10,000 to "Oreos"\
  **Ray:** I like their product! I wanted 'em to have a little walkin' around money!

Here are some things that I use, enjoy, and endorse. You might like them too!
None of these have paid me, although in some cases I'm friendly with the staff.
In fact, I generally pay them because I value what they make or do and I want
them to keep existing.

* [**Sound Retro co**](https://soundretro.co/) is a retro hardware repair and
  restoration shop located here in Seattle, but accepting shipped orders from
  all over the US. If you've got an old game console or audio equipment that
  you want to give a new lease on life, check it out!

* [**Scarecrow Video**](https://scarecrowvideo.org/) is one of the last great
  independent video libraries. It was my local video store back in the 90s, and
  it managed to survive the mass extinction and go on to become a non-profit
  dedicated to preserving physical media. It offers rent-by-mail throughout the
  US (maybe elsewhere in North America too?), and has a truly massive
  collection. Down with streaming, up with preservation!

* [**iBroadcast**](https://www.ibroadcast.com/home/) is a web music service of
  the sort that practically died out when streaming became big (there may be a
  theme here). Instead of renting listening time from a corporation that pays
  out pennies to artists, you just upload your own music files that you bought
  and own and listen to them from the web. It's a better way to enjoy music,
  and it's also free (although I recommend paying for premium because, again,
  I want them to keep existing.)

* **Your local public library** is a fantastic resource in ways you may not
  even realize! Checking out books is great, and if it's hard for you to find
  time to sit down and read consider listening to audiobooks while you take a
  walk or do some knitting. Many libraries also lend movies, and even hiking
  great or other tools. Librarians are also super helpful for finding any kind
  of information you might possibly want. Check it out!

## Friends

These are some of my pals who have their own websites. If you're bored or just
looking for more of a taste of the old web, give them a click!

## Friends' Projects

These are cool things my friends are working on that I think could use a bit
more visibility.

* [**ALttpR Asyncs**](https://alttprasyncs.com/) is a searchable catalog of
  _The Legend of Zelda: A Link To The Past_ Randomizer seeds along with times
  from other players to compare against your own time.
